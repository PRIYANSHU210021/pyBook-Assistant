Its importance as a language for learning and creating programs is ever \\ngrowing. According to US News, in USA,8 of the top 10 C omputer Science departments \\nteach Python in introductory computer courses. Almost all the universities in USA and \\nEurope are teaching Python in their course curriculum. In India, Python has already \\nbeen introduced into IITs, IIITs, NITs and in a couple of universities. Soon it will spread \\nto all the universities in India. Thus, Python is chosen as the best introductory \\nprogramming language and going to replace C completely.  \\nAccording to blog.codeeval.com, Python has been ranked as number 1 among the most \\npopular coding languages for the last  4 years continuously . The PYPL Popularity of \\nProgramming Language Index  gives 2 nd rank for Python as most widely searched and \\nlearned language on Internet. According to sitepoint.com, Python is in the top place in \\nterms of programmers who draw highest salary in the software development industry.  \\nDuring the year 2017, IEEE Spectrum has given 1st rank for Python in terms of increasing \\npopularity. The same organization gave 4 th rank for Python during 2016. According to \\nTIOBE, a Netherlands company that checks the software code and analyses the market \\ntrends, Python takes 4th position in the most popular programming languages during \\n2016.   \\nAt present, Java occupies number 1 rank as the most used programming language since \\nalmost all the projects are developed in Java. Python is already occup ying 2nd to 4 th \\nposition and will be the most demanded language after Java in near future. Python is \\nused with other programming languages on Internet as well as for developing standalone \\napplications. Python programmers are paid high salaries in the software development \\nindustry. Hence, it is time for beginners as well as existing programmers to focus their \\nattention on Python.  \\nAt the student level, learning Python is compulsory if it i s introduced as a subject of \\nstudy in their college or university. Even if the student does not learn Python in their \\ngraduation or P.G., he or she should learn it sooner or later, because most of the software \\ncompanies are expecting students to have knowl edge in Python. Learning Python will \\nhelp students to be successful in interviews. It will help professionals to occupy better \\npositions with higher salaries.  \\nIt is surprising that all the existing books on Python are written by foreign authors. \\nMoreover, these books are making the subject more complicated. Hence, there is a need \\nof writing a book specifically for Indian students. The present book is an effort in that \\ndirection. This book covers all core concepts in a methodical way. The depth of each topic \\nis decided and discussed based on its importance level. All concepts are explained in a \\nlucid manner with hundreds of programming examples.'),\n",

Hence, it is \\nadvised that the readers start reading this book from the beginning unless they have \\nsome previous knowledge of the subject. The first 6 chapters will help bring readers from \\nthe novice stage to a stage where they will have gained a proper understanding of the \\nfundamentals. These chapters cover the concepts of Python and PVM along with the \\nbasic elements of writing a Python program. These 6 chapters are very important for all \\nbeginners.  \\nChapter 7 covers the concept of arrays that are useful to handle groups of elements. This \\nchapter covers various ways of creating arrays and working with arrays. The chapter also \\ndiscusses how to work with multidimensional arrays using the numpy package.  \\nChapter 8 introduces strings and characters, performing various operations on strings, \\nretrieving sub strings and formatting stirrings.  \\nChapter 9 is on functions. This chapter explains the differences between a function and \\nmethod, creating and using functions and recursive functions. It also discusses different \\ntypes of arguments like formal arguments, actual arguments, positional arguments and \\ndefault arguments. ‘lambdas’ is another important topic discussed in this chapter. \\nChapter 10 gives information on lists and tuples. A list is useful to store several \\nelements, either of the same type or different types. It is possible to access and modify \\nthe elements of a list. A tuple is similar to a list. In case of a tuple, we can access or view \\nthe elements but we cannot modify them.  \\nChapter 11 is about dictionaries, which store the data in the form of key and value pairs. \\nConverting strings and lists into dictionaries is also discussed in this chapter. \\nChapter 12 gives overview of OOPS and discusses the concepts like class, object, \\nencapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism and how to implement these \\nconcepts in Python. These concepts become the platform for all Object Oriented \\nprogramming languages.  \\nChapter 13 specifically shows how to deal with classes and objects. The reader will be \\nable to create classes and objects along with understanding constructors and methods in \\nthis chapter. \\nChapter 14 covers two most important topics of OOPS: inheritance and polymorphism. It \\ncovers concepts like method overloading and method overriding in Python.  \\nChapter 15 is about abstract classes and interfaces. Readers can understand the usage \\nand differences between the abstract classes and interfaces after reading this chapter. \\nChapter 16 is on exceptions which are nothing but errors which occur in Python \\nprograms and how to handle these errors. This chapter also shows how the programmer \\ncan create his or her own exceptions.  \\nChapter 17 is on files. This chapter discusses various types of files, pickle concept and \\nrandom accessing of file contents.'),\n",

These expressions are useful to retrieve data based on an \\nexpression. \\nChapter 19 is about data structures like stacks, linked lists and queues. \\nChapter 20 is devoted to date and time, formatting them, comparing them and sorting \\nthem. Calendar module is also introduced in this chapter. \\nChapter 21 is for discussing threads which are individual processes created inside PVM. \\nCreating threads and performing single tasking and multitasking are shown in this \\nchapter. Also, advanced topics like thread synchronization and deadlocks are discussed. \\nChapter 22 is for developing programs in GUI. Here, we discuss about how to create \\ncolors, fonts, drawing using various shapes and creating widgets like push buttons, \\nlabels, message boxes, scrollbars etc. \\nChapter 23 is on networking. This chapter deals with networking fundamentals, \\nprotocols and working with TCP/IP and UDP protocols in Python programs. \\nChapter 24 discusses how to connect to a database like Oracle or MySQL and retrieve \\ndata from the database and utilize the data in the Python programs.   \\nChapter 25 deals with the most demanded technology called data science. This is related \\nto data analysis and visualization in order to guide a business company.  \\nWherever possible, the installations of the softwares are also discussed with screenshots. \\nFor example, installation of numpy, Oracle, MySQL, their drivers etc. are shown in the \\nbook. \\nEvery chapter is concluded with ‘Points to Remember’ section where important points of \\nthat chapter are presented one by one to the reader. These points provide a quick review \\nand enable the reader to easily migrate to the subsequent chapters. Remembering these \\npoints will help readers to answer the questions asked in the interviews on Python.    \\nVersion used in this book \\nCurrently, python.org maintains two versions of Python. They are 2.x and 3.x.  “Python \\n2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.” – this is what Python\\npeople said in their website. So, it is better to go for Python’s 3.x version.  The most \\nstable version of Python is 3.3, which was released in the year 2012. The version used in \\nthis book is 3.6.4, which is the latest one by the time the present edition of this book is \\nreleased. However, all programs in this book will run in all the versions starting from 3.3 \\nonwards.'),\n",

In these languages, there will be more focus on \\nwriting the code using functions. For example, we can imagine a C program as a \\ncombination of several functions. Computer scientists thought that programming will \\nbecome easy for human beings to understand if it is based on real life examples. Hence, \\nthey developed Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and .NET where \\nprogramming is done through classes and objects. Programmers started migrating from C \\nto Java and Java soon became the most popular language in the software community. \\nIn Java, a programmer should express his logic through classes and objects only. It is not \\npossible to write a program without writing at least one class! This makes programming \\nlengthy. For example, a simple program to add two numbers in Java looks like this: \\n//Java program to add two numbers \\nclass Add  //create a class \\n{ \\n    public static void main(String args[])  //start execution  \\n    { \\n        int a, b;  //take two variables  \\n        a = b = 10;  //store 10 in to a, b  \\n        System.out.println(\"Sum= \"+ (a+b));  //display their sum \\n    } \\n} \\nProgrammers understood that in certain cases where there is no need to go for classes or \\nobjects, this type of coding is consuming more time. In such cases, they do not want to \\ncreate classes or objects; rather they want to write C style coding. The same program to \\nadd two numbers can be written in C as: \\n/* C program to add two numbers */ \\n#include<stdio.h>  /* include standard header file */ \\nvoid main()  /* start execution */ \\n{ \\n     int a, b;  /* take two variables */ \\n     a = b = 10;   /* store 10 in to a, b */ \\nINTRODUCTION \\nTO PYTHON \\nChapter \\n1 \\nP'),\n",

Hence, Python is gaining \\npopularity among the programming folks. Of course, there are several other features of \\nPython which we will discuss in future which make it the preferred choice of most \\nprogrammers. \\nComing to a bit of history, Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in the year 1991 \\nat the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science managed by the Dutch \\nGovernment. Van Rossum was working on a project to develop system utilities in C where \\nhe had to interact with the Bourne shell available in UNIX. He felt the necessity of \\ndeveloping a language that would fill the gap between C and the shell. This has led to the \\ncreation of Python.  \\nVan Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from the TV show, Monty \\nPython’s Flying Circus . Python’s first working version was ready by early 1990 and Van \\nRossum released it for the public on February 20, 1991.

Its source code can be accessed and \\nmodified as required in the projects.  \\nFeatures of Python \\nThere are various reasons why Python is gaining good popularity in the programming \\ncommunity. The following are some of the important features of Python: \\n\\uf071 Simple: Python is a simple programming language. When we read a Python program, \\nwe feel like reading English sentences. It means more clarity and less stress on \\nunderstanding the syntax of the language. Hence, developing and understanding \\nprograms will become easy.  \\n\\uf071 Easy to learn: Python uses very few keywords. Its programs use very simple \\nstructure. So, developing programs in Python become easy. Also, Python resembles C \\nlanguage. Most of the language constructs in C are also available in Python. Hence, \\nmigrating from C to Python is easy for programmers.  \\n\\uf071 Open source: There is no need to pay for Python software. Python can be freely \\ndownloaded from www.python.org website. Its source code can be read, modified and \\ncan be used in programs as desired by the programmers.  \\n\\uf071 High level language: Programming languages are of two types: low level and high \\nlevel. A low level language uses machine code instructions to develop programs. \\nThese instructions directly interact with the CPU. Machine language and assembly \\nlanguage are called low level languages.  \\nHigh level languages use English words to develop programs. These are easy to learn \\nand use. Like COBOL, PHP or Java, Python also uses English words in its programs \\nand hence it is called high level programming language.  \\n\\uf071 Dynamically typed: In Python, we need not declare anything. An assignment \\nstatement binds a name to an object, and the object can be of any type. If a name is \\nassigned to an object of one type, it may later be assigned to an object of a different \\ntype. This is the meaning of the saying that Python is a dynamically typed language. \\nLanguages like C and Java are statically typed. In these languages, the variable \\nnames and datatypes should be mentioned properly. Attempting to assign an object \\nof the wrong type to a variable name triggers error or exception.  \\n\\uf071 Platform independent: When a Python program is compiled using a Python \\ncompiler, it generates byte code. Pytho n’s byte code represents a fixed set of \\ninstructions that run on all operating systems and hardware. Using a Python Virtual \\nMachine (PVM), anybody can run these byte code instructions on any computer \\nsystem. Hence, Python programs are not dependent on any specific operating system. \\nWe can use Python on almost all operating systems like UNIX, Linux, Windows,'),\n",

Python programs will give the same result since they \\nare platform independent. Once a Python program is written, it can run on any \\ncomputer system using PVM. However, Python also contains some system dependent \\nmodules (or code), which are specific to operating system. Programmers should be \\ncareful about such code while developing the software if they want it to be completely \\nportable. \\n\\uf071 Procedure and object oriented: Python is a procedure oriented as well as an object \\noriented programming language. In procedure oriented programming languages (e.g. \\nC and Pascal), the programs are built using functions and procedures. But in object \\noriented languages (e.g. C++ and Java), the programs use classes and objects.  \\nLet’s get some idea on objects and classes. An object is anything that exists physically in \\nthe real world. Almost everything comes in this definition. Let ’s take a dog with the name \\nSnoopy. We can say Snoopy is an object since it physically exists in our house. Objects \\nwill have behavior represented by their attributes (or properties) and actions. For \\nexample, Snoopy has attributes like height, weight, age and color. These attributes are \\nrepresented by variables in programming. Similarly, Snoopy can perform actions like \\nbarking, biting, eating, running, etc. These actions are represented by methods \\n(functions) in programming. Hence, an object contains variables and methods.  \\nA class, on the other hand, does not exist physically. A class is only an abstract idea \\nwhich represents common behavior of several objects. For example, dog is a class. When \\nwe talk about dog, we will have a picture in our mind where we imagine a head, body, \\nlegs, tail, etc. This imaginary picture is called a class. When we take Snoopy, she has all \\nthe features that we have in our mind but she exists physically and hence she becomes \\nthe object of dog class. Similarly all the other dogs like Tommy, Charlie, Sophie, etc. \\nexhibit same behavior like Snoopy. Hence, they are all objects of the same class, i.e. dog \\nclass. We should understand the point that the object Snoopy exists physically but the \\nclass dog does not exist physically. It is only a picture in our mind with some attributes \\nand actions at abstract level. When we take Snoopy, Tommy, Charlie and Sophie, they \\nhave these attributes and actions and hence they are all objects of the dog class. \\nAs we described in the preceding paragraph, a class indicates common behavior of \\nobjects. This common behavior is represented by attributes and actions. Attributes are \\nrepresented by variables and actions are performed by methods (functions). So, a class \\nalso contains variables and methods just like an object does . Figure 1.2 shows \\nrelationship between a class and its object:'),\n",

We should \\nunderstand that bird (class) is only an idea that defines some attributes and actions. A \\nparrot and sparrow have the same attributes and actions but they exist physically. \\nHence, they are objects of the bird class.  \\nObject oriented languages like Python, Java and .NET use the concepts of classes and \\nobjects in their programs. Since class does not exist physically, there will not be any \\nmemory allocated when the class is created. But, object exists physically and hence, a \\nseparate block of memory is allocated when an object is created. In Python language, \\neverything like variables, lists, functions, arrays etc. are treated as objects.  \\n\\uf071 Interpreted: A program code is called source code. After writing a Python program, \\nwe should compile the source code using Python compiler. Python compiler \\ntranslates the Python program into an intermediate code called byte code. This byt e \\ncode is then executed by PVM. Inside the PVM, an interpreter converts the byte code \\ninstructions into machine code so that the processor will understand and run that \\nmachine code to produce results.  \\n\\uf071 Extensible: The programs or pieces of code written in C or C++ can be integrated into \\nPython and executed using PVM. This is what we see in standard Python that is \\ndownloaded from www.python.org. There are other flavors of Python where programs \\nfrom other languages can be integrated into Python. For example, Jython is useful to \\nintegrate Java code into Python programs and run on JVM (Java Virtual Machine). \\nSimilarly, Iron Python is useful to integrate .NET programs and libraries into Python \\nprograms and run on CLR (Common Language Runtime).  \\n\\uf071 Embeddable: We can insert Python programs into a C or C++ program. Several \\napplications are already developed in Python which can be integrated into other \\nprogramming languages like C, C++, Delphi, PHP, Java and .NET. It means'),\n",

Programmers can develop programs very easily \\nusing the modules available in the Python library.  \\n\\uf071 Scripting language: A scripting language is a programming language that does not \\nuse a compiler for executing the source code. Rather, it uses an interpreter to \\ntranslate the source code into machine code on the fly (while running). Generally, \\nscripting languages perform supporting tasks for a bigger application or software. For \\nexample, PHP is a scripting language that performs supporting task of taking input \\nfrom an HTML page and send it to Web server software. Python is considered as a \\nscripting language as it is interpreted and it is used on the Internet to support other \\nsoftware.   \\n\\uf071 Database connectivity: A database represents software that stores and manipulates \\ndata. For example, Oracle is a popular database using which we can store data in the \\nform of tables and manipulate the data. Python provides interfaces to connect its \\nprograms to all major databases like Oracle, Sybase or MySql.  \\n\\uf071 Scalable: A program would be scalable if it could be moved to another operating \\nsystem or hardware and take full advantage of the new environment in terms of \\nperformance. Python programs are scalable since they can run on any platform and \\nuse the features of the new platform effectively. \\n\\uf071 Batteries included: The huge library of Python contains several small applications \\n(or small packages) which are already developed and immediately available to \\nprogrammers. These small packages can be used and maintained easily. Thus the \\nprogrammers need not download separate packages or applications in many cases. \\nThis will give them a head start in many projects. These libraries are called ‘batteries \\nincluded’.

Here, x is the program \\nname and the .py is the extension name. Every Python program is typed with an \\nextension name .py. After typing the program, the next step is to compile the program \\nusing Python compiler. The compiler converts the Python program into another code \\ncalled byte code.  \\nByte code represents a fixed set of instructions that represents all operations like \\narithmetic operations, comparison operations, memory related operations, etc., which \\nrun on any operating system and hardware. It means the byte instructions are system \\nindependent or platform independent. The size of each byte code instruction is 1 byte and \\nhence they are called with the name byte code . These byte code instructions are \\ncontained in the file x.pyc. Here, the x.pyc file represents a python compiled file.  \\nThe next step is to run the program. If we directly give the byte code to the computer, it \\ncannot execute them. Any computer can execute only binary code which comprises 1s \\nand 0s. Since the binary code is understandable to the machine (computer), it is also \\ncalled machine code. It is therefore necessary to convert the byte code into machine code \\nso that our computer can understand and execute it. For this purpose, we should use \\nPVM (Python Virtual Machine).  \\nPVM uses an interpreter which understands the byte code and converts it into machine \\ncode. PVM first understands the processor and operating system in our computer. Then \\nit converts the byte code into machine code understandable to that processor and into \\nthat format understandable to that operating system. These machine code instructions \\nare then executed by the processor and results are displayed.'),\n",

Hence, it is slow. The \\ninterpreter that is found inside the PVM runs the Python program slowly. To rectify this \\nproblem, in some flavors of Python, a compiler is added to the PVM. This compiler also \\nconverts the byte code into machine code but faster than the interpreter. This compiler is \\ncalled JIT (Just In Time) compiler. The advantage of JIT compiler is to improve speed of \\nexecution of a Python program and thus improving the performance.  \\nWe should remember that JIT compiler is not available in all Python environments. For \\nexample, the standard Python software is called CPython which is created using C \\nlanguage that does not include a JIT compiler. But, PyPy, which is created in Python \\nlanguage itself uses a JIT compiler in addition to an interpreter in the PVM. So, the PyPy \\nflavor of Python definitely offers faster execution of the Python programs than CPython. \\nFigure 1.3 shows the steps for executing a Python program: \\nFigure1.3: Steps of Execution of a Python Program \\nNormally, when we compile a Python program, we cannot see the .pyc file produced by \\nthe Python compiler and the machine code generated by the PVM. This is done internally \\nin the memory and the output is finally visible. For example, if our Python program name \\nis x.py, we can use Python compiler to compile it as: \\nC:\\\\>python x.py \\nIn the preceding statement, python is the command for calling the Python compiler. The \\ncompiler should convert the x.py file into its byte code equivalent file, x.pyc. Instead of \\ndoing this, the compiler directly displays the output or result.  \\nIf we observe, we cannot find any files in the directory with the extension .pyc. The \\nreason is that all the steps in the sequence: source code \\uf0e0byte code \\uf0e0 machine code \\n\\uf0e0 output are internally completed and then the final result is displayed.  Hence, after \\nexecution, we cannot find any .pyc file in the directory. \\nTo separately create .pyc file from the source code, we can use the following command: \\nC:\\\\>python –m py_compile x.py \\nIn the preceding command, we are calling the Python compiler with –m option. -m \\nrepresents module and the module name is py_compile. This module generates the .pyc \\nfile for the specified .py file. The compiler creates a separate directory in the current \\ndirectory by the name __pycache__ where it stores the .pyc file. The .pyc file name may be \\nsomething like: x.cpython-34.pyc. The word cpython here indicates that we are using the \\nPython compiler that was created using C. This is of course, the standard Python \\ncompiler.'),\n",

We know that the .pyc files contain \\nbyte code. We get these files after the compilation is completed. Hence, the first step is \\nover. The next step is to interpret them using PVM. This can be done by calling the \\nPython compiler as: \\nC:\\\\>python x.cpython-34.pyc \\nIn this case, we are supplying .pyc file to the Python compiler. Now, Python compiler will \\nskip the first step where it has to convert the source code into byte code as already it sees \\nthe byte code inside this .pyc file. This file is executed directly by the PVM to produce the \\noutput. Hence, the program takes less time to run and the performance will be improved. \\nThis is the reason that after the completion of the project, the .pyc files are distributed to \\nthe user who can directly run these files using PVM and view the output. \\nViewing the Byte Code \\nLet’s consider the following Python program: \\n# Python program to add two numbers \\na = b = 10  # take two variables and store 10 in to them \\nprint(\"Sum= \", (a+b))  # display their sum \\nWe can type this program in a text editor like Notepad and then save it as ‘first.py’. It \\nmeans, the first.py file contains the source code. \\nNow, let’s compile the program using Python compiler as: \\nC:\\\\>python  first.py \\nIt will display the result as: \\nSum= 20 \\nThat is ok. But we do not want the output of the program. We want to see the byte code \\ninstructions that were created internally by the Python compiler before they are executed \\nby the PVM. For this purpose, we should specify the dis module while using python \\ncommand as: \\nC:\\\\>python  –m  dis  first.py \\nIt will produce the following output: \\n  2  0 LOAD_CONST   0 (10) \\n  3 DUP_TOP \\n  4 STORE_NAME   0 (a) \\n  7 STORE_NAME   1 (b) \\n  3  10 LOAD_NAME   2 (print) \\n  13 LOAD_CONST   1 (\\'Sum= \\') \\n  16 LOAD_NAME   0 (a) \\n  19 LOAD_NAME   1 (b) \\n  22 BINARY_ADD \\n  23 CALL_FUNCTION  2 (2 positional, 0 keyword pair) \\n  26 POP_TOP \\n  27 LOAD_CONST   2 (None) \\n  30 RETURN_VALUE'),\n",

If we \\nobserve the preceding code, we can find 5 columns. The left-most or first column \\nrepresents the line number in our source program (first.py). The second column \\nrepresents the offset position of the byte code. The third column shows the name of the \\nbyte code instruction. The 4th column represents instruction's argument and the last \\ncolumn represents constants or names as specified by 4th column. For example, see the \\nfollowing instructions: \\n             10 LOAD_NAME                2 (print) \\n             13 LOAD_CONST               1 ('Sum= ') \\n             16 LOAD_NAME                0 (a) \\n             19 LOAD_NAME                1 (b) \\n             22 BINARY_ADD \\nThe LOAD_NAME specifies that this byte code instruction has 2 arguments. The name \\nthat has 2 arguments is (print) function. Since there are 2 arguments, the next byte code \\ninstructions will represent those 2 arguments as LOAD_CONST represents the string \\nconstant name ('Sum= ') and (a) and (b) as names involved in the second argument for \\nthe print function. Then BINARY_ADD instruction adds the previous (i.e. a and b) values.    \\nFlavors of Python \\nFlavors of Python refer to the different types of Python compilers. These flavors are useful \\nto integrate various programming languages into Python. The following are some of them: \\n\\uf071 CPython: This is the standard Python compiler implemented in C language. This is \\nthe Python software being downloaded and used by programmers directly from \\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/. In this, any Python program is internally \\nconverted into byte code using C language functions.  This byte code is run on the \\ninterpreter available in Python Virtual Machine (PVM) created in C language. The \\nadvantage is that it is possible to execute C and C++ functions and programs in \\nCPython.   \\n\\uf071 Jython: This is earlier known as JPython. This is the implementation of Python \\nprogramming language which is designed to run on Java platform. Jython compiler \\nfirst compiles the Python program into Java byte code. This byte code is executed by \\nJava Virtual Machine (JVM) to produce the output. Jython contains libraries which \\nare useful for both Python and Java programmers. This can be downloaded from \\nhttp://www.jython.org/. \\n\\uf071 IronPython: This is another implementation of Python language for .NET framework. \\nThis is written in C# (C Sharp) language. The Python program when compiled gives \\nan intermediate language (IL) which runs on Common Language Runtime (CLR) to \\nproduce the output. This flavor of Python gives flexibility of using both the .NET and \\nPython libraries. IronPython can be downloaded from http://ironpython.net/.\"),\n",

PyPy programs run very fast since there \\nis a JIT (Just In Time) compiler added to the PVM. PyPy can be downloaded by \\nvisiting the page: http://pypy.org/download.html. \\nSince the original Python uses only an interpreter in the Python Virtual Machine \\n(PVM), the Python programs run slowly. To improve the speed of execution, a \\ncompiler called JIT (Just In Time) is introduced into the PVM of PyPy. Hence, PyPy \\nprograms run faster than those of Python.  We can download PyPy from \\nhttp://pypy.org/download.html. \\n\\uf071 RubyPython: This is a bridge between the Ruby and Python interpreters. It encloses \\na Python interpreter inside Ruby applications. This flavor of Python can be \\ndownloaded from https://rubygems.org/gems/rubypython/versions/0.6.3. \\n\\uf071 StacklessPython: Small tasks which should run individually are called tasklets. \\nTasklets run independently on CPU and can communicate with others via channels. \\nA channel is a manager that takes care of scheduling the tasklets, controlling  \\nthem and suspending them. A thread is a process which runs hundreds of such \\ntasklets. We can create threads and tasklets in StacklessPython which is \\nreimplementation of original Python language. This can be downloaded from \\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/stackless-python/10.0. \\n\\uf071 Pythonxy: This is pronounced as Python xy and written as Python(X,Y).  \\nThis is the Python implementation that we get after adding scientific and  \\nengineering related packages. We can download Pythonxy from  \\nhttps://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html. \\n\\uf071 AnacondaPython: When Python is redeveloped for handling large-scale data \\nprocessing, predictive analytics and scientific computing, it is called Anaconda \\nPython. This implementation mainly focuses on large scale of data. This can be \\ndownloaded from https://www.continuum.io/downloads. \\nPython Virtual Machine (PVM) \\nWe know that computers understand only machine code that comprises 1s and 0s. Since \\ncomputer understands only machine code, it is imperative that we should convert any \\nprogram into machine code before it is submitted to the computer for execution. For this \\npurpose, we should take the help of a compiler. A compiler normally converts the \\nprogram source code into machine code. \\nA Python compiler does the same task but in a slightly different manner. It converts the \\nprogram source code into another code, called byte code. Each Python program \\nstatement is converted into a group of byte code instructions. Then what is byte code? \\nByte code represents the fixed set of instructions created by Python developers \\nrepresenting all types of operations. The size of each byte code instruction is 1 byte (or 8'),\n",

Python organization says that \\nthere may be newer instructions added to the existing byte code instructions from time to \\ntime. We can find byte code instructions in the .pyc file. Figure 1.4 shows the role of \\nvirtual machine in converting byte code instructions into machine code: \\nFigure 1.4: The Python Virtual Machine \\nThe role of Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is to convert the byte code instructions into \\nmachine code so that the computer can execute those machine code instructions and \\ndisplay the final output. To carry out this conversion, PVM is equipped with an \\ninterpreter. The interpreter converts the byte code into machine code and sends that \\nmachine code to the computer processor for execution. Since interpreter is playing the \\nmain role, often the Python Virtual Machine is also called an interpreter. \\nFrozen Binaries \\nWhen a software is developed in Python, there are two ways to provide the software to the \\nend user. The first way is to provide the .pyc files to the user. The user will install PVM in \\nhis computer and run the byte code instructions of the .pyc files.  \\nThe other way is to provide the .pyc files, PVM along with necessary Python library. In \\nthis method, all the .pyc files, related Python library and PVM will be converted into a \\nsingle executable file (generally with .exe extension) so that the user can directly execute \\nthat file by double clicking on it. In this way, converting the Python programs into true \\nexecutables is called frozen binaries. But frozen binaries will have more size than that of \\nsimple .pyc files since they contain PVM and library files also.  \\nFor creating frozen binaries, we need to use other party software. For example, py2exe is \\na software that produces frozen binaries for Windows operating system. We can use \\npyinstaller for UNIX or LINUX. Freeze is another program from Python organization to \\ngenerate frozen binaries for UNIX. \\nMemory Management in Python \\nIn C or C++, the programmer should allocate and deallocate (or free) memory \\ndynamically, during runtime. For example, to allocate memory, the programmer may use \\nmalloc() function and to deallocate the memory, he may use the free() function. But in'),\n",

The \\nprogrammer need not allocate memory while creating objects or deallocate memory when \\ndeleting the objects. Python’s PVM will take care of such issues. \\nEverything is considered as an object in Python. For example, strings are objects. Lists \\nare objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are also objects. For every object, \\nmemory should be allocated. Memory manager inside the PVM allocates memory required \\nfor objects created in a Python program. All these objects are stored on a separate \\nmemory called heap. Heap is the memory which is allocated during runtime. The size of \\nthe heap memory depends on the Random Access Memory (RAM) of our computer and it \\ncan increase or decrease its size depending on the requirement of the program.  \\nWe know that the actual memory (RAM) for any program is allocated by the underlying \\nOperating system. On the top of the Operating system, a raw memory allocator oversees \\nwhether enough memory is available to it for storing objects. On the top of the raw \\nmemory allocator, there are several object-specific allocators operate on the same heap. \\nThese memory allocators will implement different types of memory management policies \\ndepending on the type of the objects. For example, an integer number should be stored in \\nmemory in one way and a string should be stored in a different way. Similarly, when we \\ndeal with tuples and dictionaries, they should be stored differently.  These issues are \\ntaken care of by object-specific memory allocators.

Garbage collector is a \\nmodule in Python that is useful to delete objects from memory which are not used in the \\nprogram. The module that represents the garbage collector is named as gc. Garbage \\ncollector in the simplest way to maintain a count for each object regarding how many \\ntimes that object is referenced (or used). When an object is referenced twice, its reference \\ncount will be 2. When an object has some count, it is being used in the program and \\nhence garbage collector will not remove it from memory. When an object is found with a \\nreference count 0, garbage collector will understand that the object is not used by the \\nprogram and hence it can be deleted from memory. Hence, the memory allocated for that \\nobject is deallocated or freed.  \\nGarbage collector can detect reference cycles. A reference cycle is a cycle of references \\npointing to the first object from last object. For example, take three objects A, B and C. \\nThe object A refers to the object B whereas the object B holds a reference to the object C. \\nNow if the object C refers to the first object A, it will form a reference cycle. Figure 1.6 \\nshows the reference cycle of three objects: \\nFigure1.6: A Reference Cycle of Three Objects \\nEven if the objects A, B and C are no longer used in the Python program, still these \\nobjects contain 1 reference to each one. Since the reference count for each object is 1, the \\ngarbage collector will not remove these objects from memory. These objects stay in \\nmemory even after the program execution completes. To get around this, garbage \\ncollector uses an algorithm (logic) for detecting reference cycles and removing objects in \\nthe cycle. \\nGarbage collector classifies the objects into three generations. The newly created objects \\nare considered as generation 0 objects. First time, when the garbage collector examines \\nthe objects in memory and does not remove an object from memory due to the reason \\nthat the object is used by the program, then that object is placed into next generation, \\nsay generation 1. When the garbage collector intends to delete the objects for the second \\ntime and the object also survives for the second time, then it is placed into generation 2. \\nThus, older objects belong to generation 2. Garbage collector tries to delete younger \\nobjects which are not referenced in the program rather than the old objects.  \\nGarbage collector runs automatically. Python schedules garbage collector depending \\nupon a number called threshold. This number represents the frequency of how many \\ntimes the garbage collector removed (or collected) the objects. When the number of \\nallocations minus the number of de-allocations is greater than the threshold number, the'),\n",

One can know the threshold number by using \\nthe method get_threshold() of gc module.    \\nWhen more and more objects are created and if the system runs out of memory, then the \\nautomatic garbage collector will not run. Instead, the Python program will throw \\nexception (runtime error). When the programmer is sure that his program does not \\ncontain any reference cycles, then automatic garbage collector is best suitable. \\nIn some cases, where reference cycles are found in the program, it is better to run the \\ngarbage collector manually. For this purpose, collect() method of gc module can be used. \\nManual garbage collection can be done in two ways: time-based and event-based. If the \\ngarbage collector is called in certain intervals of time, it is called time-based garbage \\ncollection. If the garbage collector is called on the basis of an event, for example, when \\nthe user disconnects from an application, it is called event-based garbage collection. \\nHowever, running the garbage collector too frequently will slow down the program \\nexecution.  \\nComparisons between C and Python \\nIn Table 1.1, we will compare some of the important features of C and Python languages: \\nTable 1.1:  Differences between C and Python \\nC  Python \\nC is procedure -oriented programming \\nlanguage.

So, a class \\nalso contains variables and functions. \\n\\uf071 A group of objects having same behavior comes under the same class.  \\n\\uf071 The standard Python compiler is written in C language and hence called CPython. \\n\\uf071 There are other flavors of Python, namely Jython, IronPython and PyPy.  \\n\\uf071 A Python program contains source code that is first compiled by Python compiler to \\nproduce byte code. This byte code is given to Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which \\nconverts the byte code to machine code so that the processor will execute it and \\ndisplay the results.  \\n\\uf071 Python’s byte code is a set of instructions created by the Python development team to \\nrepresent all type of operations. Each byte code occupies 1 byte of memory and hence \\nthe name byte code.  \\n\\uf071 Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is the software containing an interpreter that converts \\nthe byte code into machine code depending on the operating system and hardware of \\nthe computer system where the Python program runs. \\n\\uf071 The standard PVM contains only an interpreter and hence Python is called an \\ninterpreted language.  \\n\\uf071 PVM is most often called Python interpreter.  \\n\\uf071 The PVM of PyPy contains a compiler in addition to the interpreter. This compiler is \\ncalled Just In Time (JIT) compiler which is useful to speed up the execution of the \\nPython program.  \\n\\uf071 The programmer need not allocate or deallocate memory in Python. It is the duty of \\nthe PVM to allocate or deallocate memory for Python programs.  \\n\\uf071 Memory manager is a module (or sub program) in PVM which will allocate memory for \\nobjects. Garbage collector is another module in PVM that will deallocate (or free) \\nmemory for the unused objects.  \\n\\uf071 The programmer need not call the garbage collector. It will execute automatically \\nwhen the Python program is running in memory. In addition, the programmer can \\nalso call the garbage collector whenever needed.  \\n\\uf071 The files that contain Python programs along with Python compiler and libraries that \\ncan be executed directly are called frozen binaries. \\n\\uf071 The ‘py_compile’ module converts a Python source file into a .pyc file that contains \\nbyte code instructions. Generally, the .pyc files are provided to the end user.  \\n\\uf071 When the Python source file is given, the ‘dis’ module displays the equivalent byte \\ncode instructions in human readable format.'),\n",

We started the above program with a comment line that \\ngives the aim of our program.  \\nWe all know that the data and results are always stored in computer’s memory locations. \\nThese memory locations are called ‘variables’. In the second line of our program, we \\nstored the data 10 into a variable (or memory location) by the name ‘a’ as: \\na = 10 \\nSimilarly, in the third line, we stored data 15 into another variable ‘b’ as: \\nb = 15 \\nIn the fourth line, we added them by writing a + b. The result of this sum should be \\nstored into another memory location by the name ‘c’ as: \\nc= a +b \\nSo, the result is in ‘c’. We should now display the result on the screen for the user. This is \\ndone by the print() function. The purpose of a function is to perform a task. The print() \\nfunction is already written by Python developers and we can use it for display purpose as: \\nprint(c) \\nThis will display the result 25. But, we want to display some message while displaying \\nthe result as: \\nSum= 25 \\nThis will help the user to understand the results clearly. For this purpose, we used the \\nprint() function in fifth line as: \\nprint(\"Sum= \", c) \\nHere, \"Sum= \"is called a string. A string contains a group of characters and is usually \\nenclosed in double quotes or single quotes. Strings are displayed without any change, as \\nthey are. After this string, we put a comma and then wrote ‘c’. This will display the result \\nas: \\nSum= 25 \\nExecuting a Python Program \\nThere are three ways of executing a Python program.  \\n\\uf071 Using Python’s command line window  \\n\\uf071 Using Python’s IDLE graphics window \\n\\uf071 Directly from System prompt \\nThe first two are called interactive modes where we can type the program one line at a \\ntime and the PVM executes it immediately.

For example, \\n# To find sum of two numbers \\na = 10  # store 10 into variable a \\nHere, the first line is starting with a # and hence the entire line is treated as a comment. \\nIn the second line, a = 10 is a statement.

Multi line comments are not available \\nin Python. The triple double quotes or triple single quotes are actually not multi line \\ncomments but they are regular strings with the exception that they can span multiple \\nlines. That means memory will be allocated to these strings internally. If these strings are \\nnot assigned to any variable, then they are removed from memory by the garbage \\ncollector and hence these can be used as comments.  \\nSo, using \"\"\" are \\'\\'\\' or not recommended for comments by Python people since they \\ninternally occupy memory and would waste time of the interpreter since the interpreter \\nhas to check them.  \\nIf we write strings inside \"\"\" or \\'\\'\\' and if these strings are written as first statements in a \\nmodule, function, class or a method, then these strings are called documentation strings \\nor docstrings. These docstrings are useful to create an API documentation file from a \\nPython program. An API (Application Programming Interface) documentation file is a text \\nfile or html file that contains description of all the features of software, language or a \\nproduct. When a new software is created, it is the duty of the developers to describe all \\nthe classes, modules, functions, etc. which are written in that software so that the user \\nwill be able to understand the software and use it in a proper way.  These descriptions \\nare provided in a separate file either as a text file or an html file. So, we can understand \\nthat the API documentation file is like a help file for the end user. \\nLet’s take an example to understand how to create an API documentation file. The \\nfollowing Python program contains two simple functions. The first function is add() \\nfunction that takes two numbers and displays their sum. The second one is message() \\nfunction that displays a message “Welcome to Python”. A function contains a group of \\nstatements and intends to perform a specific task. In Python, a function should start with \\nthe ‘def’ keyword. After that, we should write the function name a long with parentheses \\nas def add(). We will learn about functions fully in a later chapter.  \\nObserve that the add(x,y) function calls a print() function that displays the sum of x and \\ny. But it also contains documentation strings inside a pair of \"\"\". Similarly, the message() \\nfunction which is the second function calls a print() function that displays the message \\n“Welcome to Python”. This function also contains documentation strings written inside a \\npair of \\'\\'\\'. At the end of this program, we are calling these two functions. While calling the \\nfirst function, we are passing two values 10 and 25 and calling it as add(10, 25). While \\ncalling the second function, we are not passing any value. We are calling it as message()  \\nonly. Now, consider the following program: \\n# program with two functions \\ndef add(x, y): \\n    \"\"\" \\n    This function takes two numbers and finds their sum. \\n    It displays the sum as result.     \\n    \"\"\" \\n    print(\"Sum= \", (x+y))'),\n",

Storage is done \\nby the symbol ‘=’ which is called assignment operator. In the second statement, the value \\n15 is stored into another variable ‘b’. A variable can be imagined like a memory location \\nwhere we can store data. The name given to a variable is called identifier. Identifiers \\nrepresent names of variables, functions, objects or any such thing.  \\nDepending upon the type of data stored into a variable, Python interpreter understands \\nhow much memory is to be allocated for that variable. Hence, we need not declare the \\ndatatype of the variable explicitly like we do in case of C or Java. For example, in C or \\nJava we declare a variable as ‘int’ type as: \\nint a;    //declare a as int type variable \\na = 10;  //store 10 into a \\nBut, in Python we can simply write as: \\na = 10  \\nThis creates a variable by the name ‘a’ and stores the value 10. Since we are storing 10 \\nwhich is an integer, Python will understand that ‘a’ is of integer type variable and \\nallocates memory required to store an integer value. On the other hand, if we store a \\nstring (a group of characters) into ‘a’, then Python will understand ‘a’ as string type \\nvariable and then allocates memory required to store the string.  \\nHow Python Sees Variables \\nIn programming languages like C, Java and many other languages, the concept of \\nvariable is connected to memory location. In all languages, a variable is imagined as a \\nstorage box which can store some value. Suppose, we write a statement as: \\na = 1; \\nSome memory is allocated with the name ‘a’ and there the value ’1’ is stored. He re, we \\ncan imagine the memory as a box or container that stores the value, as shown in  \\nFigure 3.2: \\nFigure 3.2: The effect of a = 1'),\n",

If we change the value of the variable, then the box will be \\nupdated with the new value. For example, if we write: \\na = 2; \\nthen the new value ‘2’ is stored into the same box, as shown in Figure 3.3:  \\nFigure 3.3: The effect of a = 2  \\nWhen we assign one variable to another variable as: \\nint b = a; \\nA new memory box is created by the name ‘b’ and the value of the variable ‘a’ is copied \\ninto that box as shown in Figure 3.4: \\nFigure 3.4: The effect of b = a; \\nThis is how variables are visualized in other languages. However in Python, a variable is \\nseen as a tag (or name) that is tied to some value. For example, the statement: \\na = 1 \\nmeans the value ‘1’ is created first in memory and then a tag by the name ‘a’ is created to \\nshow that value as shown in Figure 3.5:   \\n \\nFigure 3.5: The effect of a = 1 \\nPython considers the values (i.e. 1 or 2 etc. ) as ‘objects’. If we change the value of ‘a’ to a \\nnew value as: \\na = 2 \\nthen the tag is simply changed to the new value (or object), as shown in Figure 3.6.

In Boolean \\nexpressions, ‘None’ datatype represents ‘False’.   \\nNumeric Types \\nThe numeric types represent numbers. There are three sub types:  \\n\\uf071 int \\n\\uf071 float \\n\\uf071 complex \\nint Datatype \\nThe int datatype represents an integer number. An integer number is a number without \\nany decimal point or fraction part. For example, 200, -50, 0, 9888998700, etc. are \\ntreated as integer numbers. Now, let’s store an integer number -57 into a variable ‘a’.  \\na = -57  \\nHere, ‘a’ is called int type variable since it is storing -57 which is an integer value. In \\nPython, there is no limit for the size of an int datatype. It can store very large integer \\nnumbers conveniently.  \\nfloat Datatype \\nThe float datatype represents floating point numbers. A floating point number is a \\nnumber that contains a decimal point. For example,  0.5, -3.4567, 290.08, 0.001 etc. are \\ncalled floating point numbers. Let’s store a float number into a variable ‘num’ as: \\nnum = 55.67998 \\nHere num is called float type variable since it is storing floating point value. Floating \\npoint numbers can also be written in scientific notation where we use ‘e’ or ‘E’ to \\nrepresent the power of 10. Here ‘e’ or ‘E’ represents ‘exponentiation’. For example, the \\nnumber 2.5 × 104  is written as 2.5E4. Such numbers are also treated as floating point \\nnumbers. For example,  \\nx = 22.55e3 \\nHere, the float value 22.55 × 103   is stored into the variable ‘x’. The type of the variable ‘x’ \\nwill be internally taken as float type. The convenience in scientific notation is that it is \\npossible to represent very big numbers using less memory. \\nComplex Datatype \\nA complex number is a number that is written in the form of a + bj or a + bJ. Here, ‘a’ \\nrepresents the real part of the number and ‘b’ represen ts the imaginary part of the \\nnumber. The suffix ‘j’ or ‘J’ after ‘b’ indicates the square root value of -\\n1. The parts ‘a’ and \\n‘b’ may contain integers or floats. For example, 3+5j, -1-5.5J, 0.2+10.5J are all complex \\nnumbers. See the following statement: \\nc1 = -1-5.5J'),\n",

Hence, Python \\ninterpreter takes the datatype of the variable ‘c1’ as complex type.  \\nWe will write a Python program (Program 1) that adds two complex numbers and displays \\ntheir sum. In this program, we store a complex number in a variable ‘c1’ and another \\ncomplex number in another variable ‘c2’ and then add them. The result of addition is \\nstored into ‘c3’ which is another complex type variable and then the value of ‘c3’ is \\ndisplayed by the print() function. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 1: A Python program to display the sum of two complex numbers.  \\n# python program to add two complex numbers \\nc1 = 2.5+2.5J \\nc2 = 3.0-0.5J \\nc3 = c1 + c2 \\nprint(\"Sum= \", c3) \\nOutput:  \\nC:\\\\>python add.py \\nSum= (5.5+2j) \\nRepresenting Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers \\nA binary number should be written by prefixing 0b (zero and b) or 0B (zero and B) before \\nthe value. For example, 0b110110, 0B101010011 are treated as binary numbers. \\nHexadecimal numbers are written by prefixing 0x (zero and x) or 0X (zero and big X) \\nbefore the value, as 0xA180 or 0X11fb91 etc. Similarly, octal numbers are indicated by \\nprefixing 0o (zero and small o) or 0O (zero and then O) before the actual value. For \\nexample, 0O145 or 0o773 are octal values.  \\nConverting the Datatypes Explicitly \\nDepending on the type of data, Python internally assumes the datatype for the variable.  \\nBut sometimes, the programmer wants to convert one datatype into another type on his \\nown. This is called type conversion  or coercion. This is possible by mentioning the \\ndatatype with parentheses. For example, to convert a number into integer type, we can \\nwrite int(num).  \\n\\uf071 int(x) is used to convert the number x into int type.

The main difference is that the \\nelements in the set datatype can be modified; whereas, the elements of frozenset cannot \\nbe modified. We can create a frozenset by passing a set to frozenset() function as: \\ns = {50,60,70,80,90} \\nprint(s) # may display {80, 90, 50, 60, 70} \\n \\nfs = frozenset(s)  # create frozenset fs \\nprint(fs) # may display frozenset({80, 90, 50, 60, 70}) \\nAnother way of creating a frozenset is by passing a string (a group of characters) to the \\nfrozenset() function as: \\nfs = frozenset(\"abcdefg\") \\nprint(fs) # may display frozenset({\\'e\\', \\'g\\', \\'f\\', \\'d\\', \\'a\\', \\'c\\', \\'b\\'}) \\nHowever, update() and remove() methods will not work on frozensets since they cannot be \\nmodified or updated.  \\nMapping Types \\nA map represents a group of elements in the form of key value pairs so that when the key \\nis given, we can retrieve the value associated with it.  The dict datatype is an example for \\na map. The ‘dict’ represents a ‘dictionary’ that contains pairs of element s such that the \\nfirst element represents the key and the next one becomes its value. The key and its \\nvalue should be separated by a colon ( : ) and every pair should be separated by a \\ncomma. All the elements should be enclosed inside curly brackets { }.  \\nWe can create a dictionary by typing the roll numbers and names of students. Here, roll \\nnumbers are keys and names will become values. We write these key value pairs inside \\ncurly braces as: \\nd = {10: \\'Kamal\\', 11: \\'Pranav\\', 12:  \\'Hasini\\', 13: \\'Anup\\', 14: \\n\\'Reethu\\'} \\nHere, d is the name of the dictionary. 10 is the key and its associated value is ‘Kamal’. \\nThe next key is 11 and its value is ‘Pranav’. Similarly 12 is the key and ‘Hasini’ is it value. \\n13 is the key and ‘Anup’ is the value and 14 is the key and ‘Reethu’ is the value.  \\nWe can create an empty dictionary without any elements as: \\nd = {} \\nLater, we can store the key and values into d as: \\nd[10] = \\'Kamal\\' \\nd[11] = \\'Pranav\\' \\nIn the preceding statements, 10 represents the key and ‘Kamal’ is its value. Similarly, 11 \\nrepresents the key and its value is ‘Pranav’. Now, if we write \\nprint(d)'),\n",

It has str \\ndatatype which represents strings. We know a string is composed of several characters. \\nHence, when we think of a character, we should think of it as an element in a string.  In \\nthe following statements, we are assigning a single character ‘A’ to a variable ‘ch’.

So, there is no concept like char \\ndatatype in Python. To work with strings, we have to access the individual characters of a \\nstring using index or position number. Suppose there is a string str where we stored a \\nstring literal ‘Bharat’ as: \\nstr = 'Bharat' \\nprint(str[0]) \\nB \\nIn the preceding example, the str[0] represents the 0 th character, i.e. ‘B’. Similarly, str[1] \\nrepresents ‘h’ and str[2] represents ‘a’ and so on. To retrieve all the characters using a for \\nloop, we can write:  \\nfor i in str: print(i)\"),\n",

We will discuss \\nabout these datatypes in the later chapters.  \\nConstants in Python \\nA constant is similar to a variable but its value cannot be modified or changed in the \\ncourse of the program execution. We know that the variable value can be changed \\nwhenever required. But that is not possible for a constant. Once defined, a constant \\ncannot allow changing its value. For example, in Mathematics, ‘pi’ value is 22 /7 which \\nnever changes and hence it is a constant. In languages like C and Java, defining \\nconstants is possible.

But its value can be changed.  \\nIdentifiers and Reserved words \\nAn identifier is a name that is given to a variable or function or class etc. Identifiers can \\ninclude letters, numbers, and the underscore character ( _ ). They should always start \\nwith a nonnumeric character. Special symbols such as ?, #, $, %, and @ are not allowed \\nin identifiers. Some examples for identifiers are salary, name11, gross_income, etc.  \\nWe should also remember that Python is a case sensitive programming language.

For \\nexample,  \\na=1; b=2 \\nif (a>b): \\n    print(\"Yes\") \\nelse: \\n    print(\"No\") \\nwill display ‘No’. Observe the expression (a>b) written after if. This is called a ‘condition’. \\nWhen this condition becomes True, if statement will display ‘Yes’ and if it becomes False, \\nthen it will display ‘No’. In this case, (1>2) is False and hence ‘No’ will be displayed.  \\nRelational operators can be chained. It means, a single expression can hold more than \\none relational operator. For example, \\nx=15 \\n10<x<20  # displays True \\nHere, 10 is less than 15 is True, and then 15 is less than 20 is True. Since both the \\nconditions are evaluated to True, the result will be True. \\n10>=x<20 # displays False \\nHere, 10 is greater than or equal to 15 is False. But 15 is less than 20 is True. Since we \\nget False and True, the result will be False. \\n10<x>20 # displays False \\nHere, 10 is less than 15 is True. But 15 is greater than 20 is False. Since we are getting \\nTrue and False, the total result will be False. So, the point is this: in the chain of \\nrelational operators, if we get all True, then only the final result will be True. If any \\ncomparison yields False, then we get False as the final result. Thus, \\n1<2<3<4 # will give True \\n \\n1<2>3<4 # will give False \\n \\n4>2>=2>1 # will give True \\nLogical Operators \\nLogical operators are useful to construct compound conditions. A compound condition is \\na combination of more than one simple condition. Each of the simple condition is \\nevaluated to True or False and then the decision is taken to know whether the total \\ncondition is True or False. We should keep in mind that in case of logical operators, False \\nindicates 0 and True indicates any other number. There are 3 logical operators as shown \\nin Table 4.4.

For example, if an element is found in the sequence \\nor not can be asserted using these operators. There are two membership operators as \\nshown here: \\n\\uf071 in  \\n\\uf071 not in \\nThe in Operator \\nThis operator returns True if an element is found in the specified sequence. If the element \\nis not found in the sequence, then it returns False.  \\nThe not in Operator \\nThis works in reverse manner for ‘in’ operator. This operator returns True if an element is \\nnot found in the sequence. If the element is found, then it returns False.  \\nLet’s take a group of strings in a list. We want to display the members of the list using a \\nfor loop where the ‘in’ operator is used. The list of names is given below: \\nnames = [\"Rani\", \"Yamini\", \"Sushmita\", \"Veena\"] \\nHere the list name is ‘names’. It contains a group of names. Suppose, we want to retrieve \\nall the names from this list, we can use a for loop as: \\nfor name in names: \\n    print (name) \\nOutput:  \\nRani \\nYamini \\nSushmita \\nVeena \\nIn the for loop, the variable ‘name’ is used. This variable will store each and every value of \\nthe list ‘names’. It means, ‘name’ values will be “Rani”, “Yamini”, etc. The operator ‘in’ will \\ncheck whether each of these names is a member of the list or not.  For example, “Rani” is \\na member of the list and hence, ‘in’ will return True. When ‘True’ is returned, the print() \\nfunction in the for loop is executed and that name is displayed. In this way, all the names \\nof the list are displayed.  \\nLet’s take another example wh ere we want to display the elements of a dictionary. The \\ndictionary ‘postal’ contains the names of the cities and their pin codes. The city name \\nbecomes a key and the pin code will become its value. For example,  \\npostal = {\\'Delhi\\': 110001, \\'Chennai\\': 600001, \\'Kolkata\\': 700001, \\n\\'Bangalore\\':560001}'),\n",

It means knowing whether the execution is from left \\nto right or right to left.  This is called associativity. ‘Associativity’ is the order in which an \\nexpression is evaluated that has multiple operators of the same precedence. Almost all \\nthe operators have left-to -right associativity in Python. Let’s take an expression value = \\n3/2*4+3+(10/4)**3-2 to understand how these precedence rules can be applied. The final \\nvalue of this expression will be 22.625, as shown in Table 4.7:  \\nTable 4.7: Evaluation of an Expression  \\nExpression  Explanation  \\nvalue = 3/2*4+3+(10/4)**3-2  \\nvalue = 3/2*4+3+2.5**3-2 The expression in ( ) is evaluated first.  \\nvalue = 3/2*4+3+15.625-2 Exponentiation ** is next.  \\nvalue = 1.5*4+3+15.625-2 \\nvalue = 6.0+3+15.625-2 \\n* and / have equal precedence.

For \\nexample, to calculate square root of 16, we can call the function as: sqrt(16). This \\nfunction returns the positive square root value of 16, i.e. 4.0.  \\nIn Python, a module is a file that contains a group of useful objects like functions, classes \\nor variables. ‘math’ is a module that contains several functions to perform mathematical \\noperations. If we want to use any module in our Python program, first we should import \\nthat module into our program by writing ‘import’ statement. For example, to import \\n‘math’ module, we can write:  \\nimport math \\nOnce this is done, we can use any of the functions available in math module. Now, we \\ncan refer to sqrt() function from math module by writing module name before the function \\nas: math.sqrt().  \\nx = math.sqrt(16) \\nHere, ‘x’ value will become 4.0.'),\n",

We can use \\nslicing operator on a string to display required characters from the string. For example, \\nname[0:2] gives 0th to 1st characters from name as:  \\nprint('Hai %s' %(name[0:2])) \\nHai Li \\nTo display floating point values, we can use %f in the formatted string. If we use %8.2f, \\nthen the float value is displayed in 8 spaces and within these spaces, a decimal point and \\nnext 2 fraction digits.  \\nWhen we use %.3f, then the float value is displayed with 3 fraction digits after the \\ndecimal point. However, the digits before decimal point will be displayed as they are. \\nConsider the following examples: \\nnum=123.456789 \\nprint('The value is: %f' % num) \\nThe value is: 123.456789 \\n \\nprint('The value is: %8.2f' %num)\"),\n",

We can mention names or indexes in these replacement fields. These \\nnames or indexes represent the order of the values. After the formatted string, we should \\nwrite member operator and then format() method where we should mention the values to \\nbe displayed. Consider the general format given below: \\nprint(‘format string with replacement fields’.format(values)) \\nTo display a single value using index in the replacement field, we can write as: \\nn1, n2, n3 = 1, 2, 3 \\nprint('number1={0}'.format(n1)) \\nnumber1=1 \\nIn the above statement, observe {0} which was replaced by the value of n1. To display all \\nthe three numbers, we can use: \\nprint('number1={0}, number2={1}, number3={2}'.format(n1, n2, n3)) \\nnumber1=1, number2=2, number3=3 \\nIn the above statement, {0}, {1}, {2} represent the values of n1, n2 and n3, respectively. \\nHence, if we change the order of these fields, we will have order of the values to be \\nchanged in the output as: \\nprint('number1={1}, number2={0}, number3={2}'.format(n1, n2, n3)) \\nnumber1=2, number2=1, number3=3 \\nAs an alternate, we can also use names in the replacement fields. But the values for \\nthese names should be provided in the format() method. Consider the following example: \\nprint('number1={two}, number2={one}, number3={three}'.format(one=n1,  \\n         two=n2, three=n3)) \\nnumber1=2, number2=1, number3=3 \\nWe can also use the curly braces without mentioning indexes or names. In this case, \\nthose braces will assume the sequence of values as they are given. Consider the following \\nstatements:  \\nprint('number1={}, number2={}, number3={}'. format(n1, n2, n3)) \\nnumber1=1, number2=2, number3=3 \\nAll the four examples given below will display the same output: \\nname, salary = 'Ravi', 12500.75 \\nprint('Hello {0}, your salary is {1}'.format(name, salary)) \\nHello Ravi, your salary is 12500.75 \\n \\nprint('Hello {n}, your salary is {s}'.format(n=name, s=salary)) \\nHello Ravi, your salary is 12500.75 \\n \\nprint('Hello {:s}, your salary is {:.2f}'.format(name, salary)) \\nHello Ravi, your salary is 12500.75 \\n \\nprint('Hello %s, your salary is %.2f' % (name, salary)) \\nHello Ravi, your salary is 12500.75\"),\n",

For example, ‘if’ is a statement \\nthat is executed by Python interpreter only once. But a loop is useful to execute \\nrepeatedly. For example, while and for are loops in Python. They are useful to execute a \\ngroup of statements repeatedly several times.  \\nThe while loop is useful to execute a group of statements several times repeatedly \\ndepending on whether a condition is True or False. The syntax or format of while loop is: \\nwhile condition: \\n    statements \\nHere, ‘statements’ represents one statement or a suite of statements. Python interpreter \\nfirst checks the condition. If the condition is True, then it will execute the statements \\nwritten after colon ( : ). After executing the statements, it will go back and check the \\ncondition again. If the condition is again found to be True, then it will again execute the \\nstatements. Then it will go back to check the condition once again. In this way, as long as \\nthe condition is True, Python interpreter executes the statements again and again. Once \\nthe condition is found to be False, then it will come out of the while loop.  \\nIn Program 9, we are using while loop to display numbers from 1 to 10. Since, we should \\nstart from 1, we will store ‘1’ into a variable ‘x’. Then we will write a while loop as: \\nwhile x<=10: \\nObserve the condition. It means, as long as x value is less than or equal to 10, continue \\nthe while loop. Since we want to display 1,2,3, … up to 10, we need this condition. To \\ndisplay x value, we can use: \\nprint(x) \\nOnce this is done, we have to increment x value by 1, by writing x+=1 or x = x+1.

The initial ‘i’ value 1 is displayed first, but it is never incremented to reach 10. Hence \\nthis loop will always display 1 and never terminates. Such a loop is called ‘infinite loop’. \\nAn infinite loop is a loop that executes forever. So, the following is an example for an \\ninfinite loop: \\ni=1 \\nwhile i<=10: \\n    print(i) \\nIt will display the value 1 forever. To stop the program, we have press Control+C at \\nsystem prompt. Another way of creating an infinite loop is to write ‘True’ in the condition \\npart of the while loop so that the Python interpreter thinks that the condition is True \\nalways and hence executes it forever. See the example: \\nwhile(True): \\n    print(\"Hai\") \\nThis loop will always display ‘Hai’ without stopping since the condition is read as ‘True’ \\nalways.  \\nInfinite loops are drawbacks in a program because when the user is caught in an infinite \\nloop, he cannot understand how to come out of the loop. So, it is always recommended to \\navoid infinite loops in any program.  \\nNested Loops \\nIt is possible to write one loop inside another loop. For example, we can write a for loop \\ninside a while loop or a for loop inside another for loop. Such loops are called ‘nested \\nloops’. Take the following for loops: \\nfor i in range(3):  # i values are from 0 to 2 \\n    for j in range(4):  # j values are from 0 to 3 \\n        print(\\'i=\\', i, \\'\\\\t\\', \\'j=\\',j)  # display i and j values \\nThe outer for loop repeats for 3 times by changing i values from 0 to 2. The inner for loop \\nrepeats for 4 times by changing j values from 0 to 3. Observe the indentation (4 spaces) \\nbefore the inner for loop. The indentation represents that the inner for loop is inside the \\nouter for loop. Similarly, print() function is inside the inner for loop.  \\nWhen outer for loop is executed once, the inner for loop is executed for 4 times. It means, \\nwhen i value is 0, j values will change from 0 to 3. So, print() function will display the \\nfollowing output: \\ni= 0 j= 0 \\ni= 0 j= 1 \\ni= 0 j= 2 \\ni= 0 j= 3 \\nOnce the inner for loop execution is completed ( j reached 3), then Python interpreter will \\ngo back to outer for loop to repeat the execution for second time.

Hence the print() function will display \\nthe following output: \\ni= 1 j= 0 \\ni= 1 j= 1 \\ni= 1 j= 2 \\ni= 1 j= 3 \\nSince the inner for loop execution is completed, again the interpreter will go back to outer \\nfor loop. This time i value will be 2 and the output will be: \\ni= 2 j= 0 \\ni= 2 j= 1 \\ni= 2 j= 2 \\ni= 2 j= 3 \\nIn this way, the print() function in the inner for loop is executed for 12 times. If we \\nobserve the output given above, we can understand that the outer for loop is executed for \\n3 times and the inner for loop is executed for 4 times. Therefore the print() function in the \\ninner for loop is executed for 3 X 4 = 12 times.  \\nWe will write a Python program to display stars ( *s ) in a right angled triangular form. \\nThe expected output in our program is given below: \\n*  \\n* *  \\n* * *  \\n* * * *  \\n* * * * *  \\n* * * * * *  \\n* * * * * * *  \\n* * * * * * * *  \\n* * * * * * * * *  \\n* * * * * * * * * * \\nIn the first row, there is only one star. In the second row, there are two stars. In the third \\nrow, there are three stars.

So, to get the next Fibonacci \\nnumber, we should add them by taking them as f1 and f2. It means, \\nf1 = f2  # take f2 as f1 \\nf2 = f  # take f as f2 \\nf = f1+ f2  # get next Fibonacci number'),\n",

Hence we can refer to the array \\nclass of ‘ar’ module as:  \\na=ar.array('i', [4,6,2,9]) \\nThe third way of importing the array module is to write: \\nfrom array import * \\nObserve the ‘*’ symbol that represents ‘all’. The meaning of this statement is this: import \\nall (classes, objects, variables etc) from the array module into our program. That means \\nwe are specifically importing the ‘array’ class (because of * symbol) of ‘array’ module. So, \\nthere is no need to mention the module name before our array name while creating it.

When talking about arrays, any \\nprogramming language like C or Java offers two types of arrays. They are: \\n\\uf071 Single dimensional arrays:  These arrays represent only one row or one column of \\nelements. For example, marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects can be written as \\n‘marks’ array, as: \\nmarks = array('i', [50, 60, 70, 66, 72]) \\n The above array contains only one row of elements. Hence it is called single \\ndimensional array or one dimensional array.  \\n\\uf071 Multi-dimensional arrays: These arrays represent more than one row and more than \\none column of elements. For example, marks obtained by 3 students each one in 5 \\nsubjects can be written as ‘marks’ array as: \\nmarks = array([[50, 60, 70, 66, 72], \\n         [60, 62, 71, 56, 70], \\n         [55, 59, 80, 68, 65]]) \\nThe first student’s marks are written in first row. The second student’s marks are in \\nsecond row and the third student’s marks are in third row. In each row, the marks \\nin 5 subjects are mentioned. Thus this array contains 3 rows and 5 columns and \\nhence it is called multi-dimensional array.\"),\n",

Hence, it is called a two \\ndimensional array. A two dimensional array is a combination of several single \\ndimensional arrays. Similarly, a three dimensional array is a combination of several \\ntwo dimensional arrays.  \\nIn Python, we can create and work with single dimensional arrays only. So far, the \\nexamples and methods discussed by us are applicable to single dimensional arrays. \\nPython does not support multi-dimensional arrays. But that is not a bad news. We can \\nconstruct multidimensional arrays using third party packages like numpy (numerical \\npython). The following sections are devote d for a discussion on ‘numpy’ which is very \\nimportant for Python programmers.  \\nWorking with Arrays using numpy \\nnumpy is a package that contains several classes, functions, variables etc. to deal with \\nscientific calculations in Python. numpy is useful to create and also process single and \\nmulti-dimensional arrays. In addition, numpy contains a large library of mathematical \\nfunctions like linear algebra functions and Fourier transforms. To get complete help on \\nnumpy, the reader can refer to the following link at scipy.org:  \\nhttp://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ \\nThe arrays which are created using numpy are called n dimensional arrays where n can \\nbe any integer. If n=1, it represents a one dimensional array. If n=2, it is a two \\ndimensional array. Similarly, if n=3, it is a three dimensional array. The arrays created in \\nnumpy can accept only one type of elements. We cannot store different datatypes into \\nsame array.  \\nTo work with numpy, we should first import numpy module into our Python programs as: \\nimport numpy \\nThis will import numpy module into our program so that we can use any of the objects \\nfrom that package. But, to refer to an object we should use the format: numpy.object.

The format of slicing \\noperation is given here: \\narrayname[start:stop:stepsize] \\nThe default value for ‘start’ is 0, for ‘stop’ is n (n is number of elements) and for ‘stepsize’ \\nis 1. Counting starts from 0th position. For example, if we write: \\na = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] \\na[1:6:2] \\nHere, ‘start’ is 1. So, it will extract from 1 st element, i.e. from 11. Since ‘stop’ is 6, it will \\nstop at one elemen t prior to 6. That means it will stop at 15. Since ‘stepsize’ is 2, we \\nshould add 2 to the starting index to get the next element index, as: 1+2 = 3 rd element \\nand then 3+2= 5 th element. So, the following elements will be extracted: [11, 13, 15]. \\nFigure 7.8 shows an example of slicing: \\nFigure 7.8: Slicing Example \\nSuppose, we write a[:] or a[::] without specifying anything for start, stop and stepsize, it \\nwill extract from 0th element till the end of the array. So, all elements are extracted. \\nSuppose, we write a[2:], it starts at 2 nd element and ends at last element. So, the \\nextracted array will be:  \\n[12, 13, 14, 15] \\nWhen negative number ‘i’ is used for ‘start’, it should be taken as n+i. When negative \\nnumber ‘j’ is used for ‘stop’, it should b e taken as n+j. When negative number is used for \\n‘stepsize’, the stepping goes towards smaller indexes. Thus, if we write: \\na[-1:-4:-1] \\nSince there are totally 6 elements in the array ‘a’, we have ‘start’ as 6 -1 = 5, ‘stop’ is 6 -\\n4=2, and ‘stepsize’ is -1, i.e. going towards least index. Hence, it will retrieve elements \\nstarting from 5 th element till one element prior to 2 nd element going backwards. So,  \\nthe retrieved array will be: [15, 14, 13].

It is also known by alias name array. Let’s \\nremember that there is another class ‘array’ in Python that is different from numpy’s \\n‘array’ class. This class contains the following important attributes (or variables): \\nThe ndim Attribute \\nThe ‘ndim’ attribute represents the number of dimensions or axes of the array. The \\nnumber of dimensions is also referred to as ‘rank’. For a single dimensional array, it is 1 \\nand for a two dimensional array, it is 2. Consider the following code snippet: \\narr1 = array([1,2,3,4,5])  # 1D array \\nprint(arr1.ndim)  \\nThe preceding lines of code will display the following output: \\n1 \\nNow, consider the following lines of code: \\narr2 = array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])  # 2D array with 2 rows and 3 elements  \\nprint(arr2.ndim)  \\nThe preceding lines of code will display the following output: \\n2 \\nThe shape Attribute \\nThe ‘shape’ attribute gives the shape of an array. The shape is a tuple listing the number \\nof elements along each dimension. A dimension is called an axis. For a 1D array, shape \\ngives the number of elements in the row. For a 2D array, it specifies the number of rows \\nand columns in each row. We can also change the shape using ‘shape’ attribute. \\nConsider the following code snippet: \\narr1 = array([1,2,3,4,5]) \\nprint(arr1.shape)  \\nThe preceding lines of code will display the following output: \\n(5,)   # no. of elements'),\n",

The elements are stored in the contiguous memory locations as shown in  \\nFigure 7.9: \\nFigure 7.9:\\n The arrangement of 2D array elements in the memory \\nThe ones() and zeros() Functions \\nThe ones() function is useful to create a 2D array with several rows and columns where \\nall the elements will be taken as 1. The format of this function is: \\nones((r, c), dtype) \\nHere, ‘r’ represents the number of rows and ‘c’ represents the number of columns. ‘dtype’ \\nrepresents the datatype of the elements in the array. For example, \\na = ones((3, 4), float) \\nwill create a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns and the datatype is taken as float. If \\n‘dtype’ is omitted, then the default datatype taken will be ‘float’. Now, if we display ‘a’, we \\ncan see the array as: \\n[[1. 1. 1. 1.] \\n [1. 1. 1. 1.] \\n [1. 1. 1. 1.]] \\nThe decimal point after each element represents that the elements are float type. \\nJust like the ones() function, we can also use the zeros() function to create a 2D array \\nwith elements filled with zeros. Suppose, we write:  \\nb = zeros((3,4), int) \\nThen a 2D array with 2 rows and 4 columns will be created where all elements will be 0s, \\nas shown below: \\n[[0  0  0  0] \\n [0  0  0  0] \\n [0  0  0  0]]'),\n",

The syntax of writing this function is: \\nreshape(arrayname, (n, r, c)) \\nHere, ‘arrayname’ represents the name of the array whose elements to be converted. ‘n’ \\nindicates the number of arrays in the resultant array. ‘r’ , ‘c’ indicates the number of \\nrows and columns, respectively. For example, we take a 1D array ‘a’ with 6 elements as: \\na = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) \\nTo convert ‘a’ into a 2D array using the reshape() function, we can write: \\nb = reshape(a, (2, 3)) \\nWe are converting the elements of the array ‘a’ into a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 \\ncolumns, and the resultant array is ‘b’. So, the 2D array ‘b’ looks like this: \\n[[1  2  3] \\n [4  5  6]] \\nObserve the starting two pairs of square brackets which indicate that it is a 2D array. \\nSuppose, we write: \\nb = reshape(a, (3, 2)) \\nThis will convert ‘a’ into a 2D array with 3 rows and 2 columns that looks like this: \\n[[1  2] \\n [3  4] \\n [5  6]] \\nIt is possible to use the reshape() function to convert a 1D array into a 3D array. Let’s \\ntake a 1D array ‘a’ with 12 elements as: \\na = arange(12) \\nHere, we are creating the array ‘a’ with 12 elements starting from 0 to 11 as: \\n[0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11]'),\n",

In the reshape() function, after \\n‘a’, observe the figures (2, 3, 2). They represent that we want 2 arrays each with 3 rows \\nand 2 columns. So, the resultant 3D array ‘b’ looks like this: \\n[[[ 0  1] \\n  [ 2  3] \\n  [ 4  5]] \\n \\n [[ 6  7] \\n  [ 8  9] \\n  [10 11]]] \\nSo, ‘b’ is a 3D array of size 2x3x2. Suppose, we write:  \\nb = reshape(a, (3, 2, 2)) \\nThen we can expect a 3D array with 3 inner arrays each one having 2 rows and 2 \\ncolumns of elements. It means the size of ‘b’ will be 3x2x2 and can be displayed as: \\n[[[ 0  1] \\n  [ 2  3]] \\n \\n [[ 4  5] \\n  [ 6  7]] \\n \\n [[ 8  9] \\n  [10 11]]] \\nIndexing in Multi-dimensional Arrays \\nIndex represents the location number.

Suppose ‘a’ is the array name. len(a) \\nfunction will give the number of rows in the array. a[0] represents the 0 th row, a[1] \\nrepresents the 1 st row, etc. So, in general, a[i] represents the i th row elements. Hence, to \\ndisplay only rows of the 2D array, we can write: \\nfor i in range(len(a)): \\n    print(a[i]) \\nEach row may contain some columns which represent the elements. To know, how many \\nelements are there in a row, we can use len(a[i]). Here, if i = 0, then len(a[0]) represents \\nthe number of columns in 0 th row. Similarly if i=1, then len(a[1]) represents the number \\nof columns in 1 st row and so on. In this way, len(a[i]) represents the number of columns \\nin ith row. So, the following loops will access all elements from the 2D array: \\nfor i in range(len(a)): \\n    for j in range(len(a[i])): \\n        print(a[i][j], end=' ')\"),\n",

It means elements are available in a matrix in the form of several rows and \\ncolumns. If a matrix has only 1 row, it is called a ‘row matrix’. If a matrix has only 1 \\ncolumn, then it is called a ‘column matrix’. We can understand that the row matrix and \\ncolumn matrices are nothing but 1D arrays.   \\nWhen a matrix has more than 1 row and more than 1 column, it is called m x n matrix \\nwhere m represents the rows and n represents the columns. Thus, a 2 x 3 matrix \\ncontains 2 rows and 3 columns. We can show these matrices using numpy 2D arrays. To \\nwork with matrices, numpy provides a special object called matrix. In numpy, a matrix is \\na specialized 2D array that retains its 2D nature through operations.'),\n",

Hence, no \\nneed to mention the array size at the time of creating it. \\n\\uf071 Arrays are of two types: single dimensional arrays or 1D arrays and multi-\\ndimensional arrays, which can be 2D or 3D arrays. \\n\\uf071 Python offers only 1D arrays. If we want to create multi-dimensional arrays, we need \\nto use a separate package called numpy.  \\n\\uf071 Python’s ‘array’ module is useful to create 1D arrays.  \\n\\uf071 The simple way to create a 1D array is: arrayname = array(type code, [elements ]) \\nwhere type code ‘i’ or ‘I’ represents integer type array and ‘f’ or ‘d’ represents float type \\narray.  \\n\\uf071 An index represents the position number of an element in an array. Indexes are \\nwritten inside square brackets. For example, x[i] represents i th element of the array \\n‘x’.  \\n\\uf071 A slice represents a piece of part of an array. To mention which part of the array we \\nneed, we can using slicing operation in the form: arrayname[start:stop:stride]. For \\nexample, x[1:5:2] represents a slice of the array ‘x’ starting fro m 1 st element to 4 th \\nelement in steps of 2.  \\n\\uf071 ‘array’ class offers several methods to process the arrays, for example: append(), \\ninsert(), index(), pop(), remove(), reverse() etc.  \\n\\uf071 1D arrays in numpy can be created using functions like array(), linspace(), logspace(), \\narrange(), zeros() and ones().  \\n\\uf071 It is possible to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, \\nmultiplication, division etc. on 1D arrays. \\n\\uf071 Functions like sin(), cos(), tan(), sqrt(), pow(), sum(), prod(), min(), max(), sort() are \\navailable in numpy to process the elements of 1D arrays.  \\n\\uf071 Relational operators >, >=, <, <=, ==, != and logical functions logical_and(), \\nlogical_or(), logical_not() are used to compare the elements of two arrays.  \\n\\uf071 Aliasing an array represents giving another name to the same array. For example, b = \\na. Here we are giving alias name ‘b’ to the array ‘a’. The elements of ‘a’ are not copied \\ninto ‘b’. Also, any modifications to ‘a’ will also reflect in ‘b’ and vice versa.  \\n\\uf071 Viewing an array represents copying the elements of an array into another array. For \\nexample, b = a.view().

For \\nexample, b = a.copy(). This will create ‘b’ as a copy of the array ‘a’.

For example,  \\nstr = 'Hello' \\nTo retrieve the 0th character, we can write str[0] and to retrieve the 1 st character, we can \\nwrite str[1].  \\nch = str[0] \\nprint(ch) \\nThe preceding statements will give the following output:  \\nH \\nConsider the following statements:  \\nch1 = str[1] \\nprint(ch1) \\nThe preceding statements will give the following output:  \\ne \\nWe can also retrieve the characters from the string using slicing as: \\nch = str[0:1] \\nprint(ch) \\nThe preceding statements will give the following output:  \\nH \\nConsider the following statements:  \\nch1 = str[1:2] \\nprint(ch1)\"),\n",

In the middle of the string, we want to insert a \\nsub string. This is not possible because of immutable nature of strings. But, we can find \\na way for this problem. Let’s assume the main string is ‘str’ and sub string is ‘sub’. After \\ninserting ‘sub’ into ‘str’, the total string will be ‘str1’. To represent this total string, we will \\ndeclare an empty list ‘str1’ as: \\nstr1 = [] \\nIf n is the position where the sub string to be inserted, we will append the first n-1 \\ncharacters from str into str1. Then the entire sub string will be appended to str1. In the \\nfinal step, we will append the remaining characters (from n till the end) from str to str1. \\nThus, the total string will be available in str1 as a list. Figure 8.3 shows the insertion of a \\nsub string in a particular position into a main string.  \\nSince a list contains characters as individual elements, we have to convert the list into a \\nstring format so that we will have continuous flow of characters. See the difference \\nbetween elements of a list and of a string: \\n['I', 't', ' ', 'i', 's', ' ', 'h', 'o', 't', 's', 'u', 'm', 'm', 'e', 'r']   \\n \\nIt is hotsummer\"),\n",

A function can be written individually in a Python program. A function is called \\nusing its name. When a function is written inside a class, it becomes a ‘method’. A \\nmethod is called using one of the following ways: \\nobjectname.methodname() \\nClassname.methodname() \\nSo, please remember that a function and a method are same except their placement and \\nthe way they are called. In this chapter, we will learn how to create and use our own \\nfunctions. Creating a function means defining a function or writing a function. Once a \\nfunction is defined, it can be used by calling the function. \\nDefining a Function \\nWe can define a function using the keyword def followed by function name. After the \\nfunction name, we should write parentheses ( ) which may contain parameters. Consider \\nthe syntax of function, as shown in Figure 9.1: \\nFigure 9.1: Understanding the Function Definition \\nFor example, we can write a function to add two values as: \\ndef sum(a, b) : \\nHere, ‘def’ represents the starting of function definition. ‘sum’ is the name of the function. \\nAfter this name, parentheses ( ) are compulsory as they denote that it is a function and \\nnot a variable or something else. In the parentheses, we wrote two variables ‘a’ and ‘b’. \\nThese variables are called ‘parameters’. A parameter is a variable that receives data from \\noutside into a function. So, this function can receive two values from outside and those \\nvalues are stored in the variables ‘a’ and ‘b’.'),\n",

Generally, we should \\nwrite a string as the first statement in the function body. This string is called a ‘docstring’ \\nthat gives information about the function. Please remember a docstring is a string literal \\nthat is written as the first statement in a module, function or class. Docstrings are \\ngenerally written inside triple double quotes or triple single quotes. In our sum() function, \\nwe wrote the following docstring: \\n\"\"\" This function finds sum of two numbers \"\"\" \\nThis docstring contains only one line. But we can write docstrings spanning several lines. \\nHowever, these docstrings are optional. That means it is not compulsory to write them. \\nWhen an API (Application Programming Interface) documentation file is created, the \\nfunction name and docstring are stored in that file thus providing clear description about \\nthe function. Writing docstrings is a good programming habit.  \\nAfter writing the docstring in the function, the next step is to write other statements \\nwhich constitute the logic of the function. This reflects how to do the task. These \\nstatements should be written using proper indentation. In our example, we want to find \\nthe sum of two numbers. Hence, the logic would be: \\nc = a + b \\nprint(c) \\nThe parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ contain the values which are added and the result is stored \\ninto ‘c’. Then the result is displayed using the print() function. So, this function can \\naccept two values and display their sum.  \\nCalling a Function \\nA function cannot run on its own. It runs only when we call it. So, the next step is to call \\nthe function using its name. While calling the function, we should pass the necessary \\nvalues to the function in the parentheses as: \\nsum(10, 15) \\nHere, we are calling the ‘sum’ function and passing two values 10 and 15 to that \\nfunction. When this statement is executed, the Python interpreter jumps to the function \\ndefinition and copies the values 10 and 15 into the parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ respectively. \\nThese values are processed in the function body and result is obtained. The values \\npassed to a function are called ‘arguments’ . So, 10 and 15 are arguments.

In dynamic typing, the type of data is d etermined only during runtime, \\nnot at compile time. Dynamic typing is one of the features of Python that is not available \\nin languages like C or Java. \\nReturning Results from a Function \\nWe can return the result or output from the function using a ‘return’ s tatement in the \\nbody of the function. For example,  \\nreturn c   # returns c value out of function \\nreturn 100   # returns 100 \\nreturn lst   # return the list that contains values \\nreturn x, y, c   # returns 3 values \\nWhen a function does not return any result, we need not write the return statement in \\nthe body of the function. Now, we will rewrite our sum() function such that it will return \\nthe sum value rather than displaying it. This is done in Program 2. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 2: A Python program to find the sum of two numbers and return the result from \\nthe function.  \\n# a function to add two numbers \\ndef sum(a, b): \\n    \"\"\" This function finds sum of two numbers \"\"\" \\n    c = a+b \\n    return c   # return result'),\n",

In Python, the values are sent to \\nfunctions by means of object references. We know everything is considered as an object \\nin Python. All numbers are objects, strings are objects, and the datatypes like tuples, \\nlists, and dictionaries are also objects.

A local variable \\nis a variable whose scope is limited only to that function where it is created. That means \\nthe local variable value is available only in that function and not outside of that function. \\nIn the following example, the variable ‘a’ is declared inside myfunction() and hence it is \\navailable inside that function. Once we come out of the function, the variable ‘a’ is \\nremoved from memory and it is not available. Consider the following code:  \\n# local variable in a function \\ndef myfunction(): \\n    a=1   # this is local var \\n    a+=1   # increment it  \\n    print(a)   # displays 2 \\n \\nmyfunction() \\nprint(a)   # error, not available \\nSee the last statement where we are displaying ‘a’ value outside the function. This \\nstatement raises an error with a message: name ‘a’ is not defined.  \\nWhen a variable is declared above a function, it becomes global variable. Such variables \\nare available to all the functions which are written after it. Consider the following code:  \\n# global variable example \\na=1   # this is global var \\ndef myfunction(): \\n    b=2   # this is local var \\n    print('a= ', a)   # display globalvar \\n    print('b= ', b)   # display localvar \\n \\nmyfunction() \\nprint(a)   # available  \\nprint(b)   # error, not available \\nWhereas the scope of the local variable is limited only to the function where it is declared, \\nthe scope of the global variable is the entire program body written below it.  \\nThe Global Keyword \\nSometimes, the global variable and the local variable may have the same name. In that \\ncase, the function, by default, refers to the local variable and ignores the global variable. \\nSo, the global variable is not accessible inside the function but outside of it, it is \\naccessible.

So far, the functions we wrote \\nwere defined using the keyword ‘def’. But anonymous functions are not defined using \\n‘def’.

Then colon ( : ) \\nrepresents the beginning of the function that contains an expression x * x. Please observe \\nthat we did not use any name for the function here. So, the format of lambda functions \\nis: \\nlambda argument_list : expression \\nNormally, if a function returns some value, we assign that value to a variable as: \\ny = square(5) \\nBut, lambda functions return a function and hence they should be assigned to a function \\nas: \\nf = lambda x: x*x \\nHere, ‘f’ is the function name to which the lambda expression is assigned.

This function actually \\nmodifies or decorates the value of the function passed to the decorator function. As \\nan example, let’s write inner() function in the decor() function.

Return the inner function that has processed or decorated the value. In our example, \\nin the last statement, we were returning inner() function using return statement. \\nWith this, the decorator is completed.  \\n The next question is how to use the decorator. Once a decorator is created, it can be \\nused for any function to decorate or process its result. For example, let’s take num() \\nfunction that returns some value, e.g. 10. \\ndef num(): \\n    return 10 \\n Now, we should call decor() function by passing num() function name as: \\nresult_fun = decor(num) \\nNow the name ‘num’ is copied into the parameter of the decor() function. Thus, ‘fun’ \\nrefers to ‘num’. In the inner() function, ‘value’ represents 10 and it is incremented by 2. \\nThe returned function ‘inner’ is referenced by ‘result_fun’. So, ‘result_fun’ indicates the \\nresultant function. Call this function and print the result as: \\nprint(result_fun()) \\nThis will display 12. Thus the value returned by the num() function (i.e. 10) is \\nincremented by 2 by the decor() function.

For example, to apply our decor() function to the num() \\nfunction, we can write @decor statement above the function definition as: \\n@decor   # apply decorator decor to the following function \\ndef num(): \\n    return 10\"),\n",

Starting from \\nsimple problems like adding two numbers to very complex problems like designing the \\nengine of an aircraft, any problem can be solved through programming. When there is a \\nsimple problem, the programmer can solve it by writing a simple program. But when \\nthere is a complex problem, he may have to develop a lengthy code.  \\nSolving a complex problem is a challenging task for the programmer. For this purpose, \\nstructured programming is the strategy used by programmers in general. In structured \\nprogramming, the main task is divided into several parts called sub tasks and each of \\nthese sub tasks is represented by one or more functions. By using these functions, the \\nprogrammer can accomplish the main task. To understand this concept, let’s take an \\nexample where we are supposed to calculate the net salary of an employee. Every \\nemployee will have some basic salary. The company may provide some benefits like \\ndearness allowance (da) and house rent allowance (hra), which when added to basic \\nsalary will give the gross salary. So, \\nGross salary = basic salary + da + hra. \\nThe net salary or take home salary is calculated based on gross salary. After making \\ndeductions like provident fund and income tax from the gross salary, the remaining \\namount is called net salary. So,    \\nNet salary = gross salary - pf – income tax.  \\nHence, in a program to calculate the net salary, we need to calculate the following: da, \\nhra, pf and income tax. All these will come under sub tasks and to represent these sub \\ntasks, we can write functions. Finally, using these functions we can calculate the net \\nsalary of the employee. This methodology is called structured programming or sometimes \\nfunctional programming. Consider the diagram given in Figure 9.7: \\nFigure 9.7: Structured Programming Methodology'),\n",

For \\nexample, to print the student’s name, we can write: \\nprint(student[1]) \\nThe name of student appears as given below: \\nVenu gopal \\nSlicing represents extracting a piece of the list by mentioning starting and ending \\nposition numbers. The general format of slicing is: [start: stop: stepsize]. By default, \\n‘start’ will be 0, ‘stop’ will be the last element and ‘stepsize’ will be 1. For example, \\nstudent[0:3:1] represents a piece of the list containing 0th to 2nd elements. \\nprint(student[0:3:1]) \\nThe elements are given below: \\n[10, 'Venu gopal', 'M'] \\nWe can also write the above statement as: \\nprint(student[:3:]) \\nThe same elements appears as shown following: \\n[10, 'Venu gopal', 'M'] \\nHere, since we did not mention the starting element position, it will start at 0 and \\nstepsize will be taken as 1. Suppose, we do not mention anything in slicing, then the total \\nlist will be extracted as: \\nprint(student[::])\"),\n",

To append a new \\nelement to the list, we should use the append() method.

This can be done \\neasily by using the reverse() method, as: \\nlist.reverse() \\nThis will reverse the order of elements in the list and the reversed elements are available \\nin the list. Suppose, we do not have the reverse() method, then how can we develop logic \\nto display the elements in reverse order? This can be done using while loop and accessing \\nthe elements in reverse order. For example, let’s assume a list with 5 elements. The \\npositions of these elements can be specified using indexing, as: list[0] to list[4]. To display \\nin reverse order, we should follow the order: list[4] to list[0]. The following while loop can \\nbe used to display the list in reverse order: \\nwhile i>=0:   # i represents initially 4.  \\n    print(list[i])  # display from 4th to 0th elements \\n    i-=1   # decrease the position every time. \\nIn the previous code, ‘i’ starts with a value ‘n -1’ where ‘n’ represents the number of \\nelements of the list. Thus if the list has 5 elements, i would start from 4 th element \\nonwards till 0th element.  \\nAnother way to access elements in reverse order is by using negative indexing. When we \\nwrite list[-1], it represents the last element. List[-2] represents 2 nd element from the end. \\nHence, we should display from list[-1] to list[-5] so that the list will be displayed in \\nreverse order.  \\ni=-1  # last element \\nwhile i>=-5:  # display from -1th to -5th elements \\n    print(days[i]) \\n    i-=1   # decrease the position every time.'),\n",

For example, if the list is ‘x’, then: \\nn1 = max(x)   # n1 gives the biggest element  \\nn2=  min(x)   # n2 gives the smallest element  \\nIf we do not want to use these functions, but want to find the biggest and smallest \\nelements in the list, how is it possible? For this purpose, we should develop our own \\nlogic. \\nFirst of all, we will store the elements in a list. Let’s take the example list as: \\nx = [20, 10, 5, 20, 15] \\nThe list elements here are represented as x[0], x[1], ... x[4]. That means the elements in \\nthe list are in general represented as x[i]. We will take the first element as the biggest and \\nalso as the smallest one as: \\nbig=x[0] \\nsmall=x[0] \\nWe will compare ‘big’ and ‘small’ elements with other elements in the list. If the other \\nelement is > big, then it should be taken as ‘big’. That means, \\nif x[i]>big: big= x[i] \\nSimilarly, if the other element is < ‘small’, we should take that other element as ‘small’ as: \\nif x[i]<small: small = x[i] \\nSince the comparison starts from 1 st element onwards, ‘i’ value will change from 1 till the \\nend of the list. This logic is used in Program 6. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 6:  A Python program to find maximum and minimum elements in a list of \\nelements. \\n# finding biggest and smallest numbers in a list of numbers  \\nx = []  # take an empty list \\n \\nprint('How many elements?

This method can be used \\nas: \\nx.sort() \\nThis will sort the list ‘x’ into ascending order. If we want to sort th e elements of the list \\ninto descending order, then we can mention ‘reverse=True’ in the sort() method as: \\nx.sort(reverse=True) \\nThis will sort the list ‘x’ into descending order.  \\nSuppose, we want to sort a list without using sort() method, we have to develop our own \\nlogic like bubble sort technique. In this technique, all the ‘n’ elements from 0 to n are \\ntaken and the first element of the list x[j] is compared with the immediate element x[j+1]. \\nIf x[j] is bigger than x[j+1], then they are swapped (or interchanged) since in ascending \\norder we expect the smaller elements to be in the first place. When two elements are \\ninterchanged, the number of elements to be sorted becomes lesser by 1.  When there are \\nno more swaps found, the ‘flag’ will become ‘False’ and w e can abort sorting. Suppose, we \\ngive the following elements for sorting: \\nOriginal list: 1, 5, 4, 3, 2 \\nCompare 1 with other elements. 1 is smallest hence no swaps.  We get:  \\n  1, 5, 4, 3, 2 \\nCompare 5 with other elements. Swap 5 with 4, 5 with 3, 5 with 2. We  \\n  get: 1, 4, 3, 2, 5 \\nCompare 4 with other elements. Swap 4 with 3, 4 with 2. We get: 1, 3,  \\n  2, 4, 5 \\nCompare 3 with other elements. Swap 3 with 2. We get: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\"),\n",

For example,  \\nn = x.count(y) \\nwill return the number of times ‘y’ is found in the list ‘x’. This method returns 0 if the \\nelement is not found in the list.  \\nIt is possible to develop our own logic for the count() method. Let’s take ‘y’ as the element \\nto be found in the list ‘x’. We will use a counter ‘c’ that counts how many times the \\nelement ‘y’ is found in the list ‘x’. Initially ‘c’ value will be 0. When ‘y’ is found in  the list, \\n‘c’ will increment by 1. We need a for loop that iterates over all the elements of the list as: \\nfor i in x: \\nThis for loop stores each element from the list ‘x’ into ‘i’. So, if ‘y == i’ we found the \\nelement and hence we should increment i value by 1. This is shown by the following code \\nsnippet:   \\nc=0 \\nfor i in x: \\n    if(y==i): c+=1 \\nprint('{} is found {} times.'.format(y, c)) \\nThe above code represents our own logic to find the number of occurrences of ‘y’ in the \\nlist ‘x’.

For example, \\nthere is a scholarship for which a group of students enrolled in a college. There is another \\nscholarship for which another group of students got enrolled. Now, we want to know the \\nnames of the students who enrolled for both the scholarships so that we can restrict \\nthem to take only one scholarship. That means, we are supposed to find out the common \\nstudents (or elements) in both the lists.  \\nLet’s take the two groups of students as two lists. First of all, we should convert the lists \\ninto sets, using set() function, as: set(list). Then we should find the common elements in \\nthe two sets using intersection() method as: \\nset1.intersection(set2) \\nThis method returns a set that contains common or repeated elements in the two sets. \\nThis gives us the names of the students who are found in both the sets. This logic is \\npresented in Program 9. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 9: A Python program to find common elements in two lists. \\n# finding common elements in two lists \\n \\n# take two lists \\nscholar1 = ['Vinay', 'Krishna', 'Saraswathi', 'Govind'] \\nscholar2 = ['Rosy', 'Govind', 'Tanushri', 'Vinay', 'Vishal'] \\n \\n# convert them into sets \\ns1 = set(scholar1) \\ns2 = set(scholar2)\"),\n",

We can refer to the individual \\nelements of the nested list, as: \\nlist[3][0]    # represents 80 \\nlist[3][1]    # represents 90 \\nOne of the main uses of nested lists is that they can be used to represent matrices. A \\nmatrix represents a group of elements arranged in several rows and columns. If a matrix \\ncontains ‘m’ rows and ‘n’ columns, then it is called m x n matrix. In Python, matrices are \\ncreated as 2D arrays or using matrix object in numpy. We can also create a matrix using \\nnested lists. \\nNested Lists as Matrices \\nSuppose we want to create a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns, we should create a list \\nwith 3 other lists as: \\nmat = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] \\nHere, ‘mat’ is a list that contains 3 lists which are rows of the ‘mat’ list. Each row \\ncontains again 3 elements as: \\n[[1,2,3],    # first row \\n [4,5,6],    # second row \\n [7,8,9]]    # third row \\nIf we use a for loop to retrieve the elements from ‘mat’, it will retrieve row by row, as: \\nfor r in mat: \\n    print(r)   # display row by row \\nBut we want to retrieve columns (or elements) in each row; hence we need another for \\nloop inside the previous loop, as: \\nfor r in mat:   \\n    for c in r:   # display columns in each row \\n        print(c, end=' ')   \\n    print() \\nAnother way to display the elements of a matrix is using indexing. For example, mat[i][j] \\nrepresents the i th row and j th column element. Suppose the matrix has ‘m’ rows and ‘n’ \\ncolumns, we can retrieve the elements as:  \\nfor i in range(len(mat)):   # i values change from 0 to m-1 \\n    for j in range(len(mat[i])):   # j values change from 0 to n-1\"),\n",

List comprehensions contain \\nvery compact code usually a single statement that performs the task.  \\nExample 1: We want to create a list with squares of integers from 1 to 10. We can write \\ncode as: \\nsquares = []   # create empty list \\nfor x in range(1, 11):   # repeat x values from 1 to 10 \\n    squares.append(x**2)   # add squares of x to the list \\nThe preceding code will create ‘squares’ list with the elements as shown below: \\n [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]  \\nThe previous code can be rewritten in a compact way as: \\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)] \\nThis is called list comprehension. From this, we can understand that a list \\ncomprehension consists of square braces containing an expression (i.e. x**2). After the \\nexpression, a for loop and then zero or more if statements can be written. Consider the \\nfollowing syntax: \\n[ expression for item1 in iterable1 if statement1 \\nfor item2 in iterable2 if statement2 \\nfor item3 in iterable3 if statement3 ... ] \\nHere, ‘iterable’ represents a list, set, tuple, dictionary or range object. The result of a list \\ncomprehension is a new list that contains elements as a result of executing the \\nexpression according to the for loops and if statements. So, we can store the result of a \\nlist comprehension in a new list.  \\nExample 2: Suppose, we want to get squares of integers from 1 to 10 and take only the \\neven numbers from the result, we can write a list comprehension as: \\neven_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2==0] \\nIf we display the list ‘even_squares’, it will display the following list: \\n[4, 16, 36, 64, 100] \\nThe same list comprehension can be written without using the if statement as: \\neven_squares = [x**2 for x in range(2, 11, 2)] \\nExample 3: If we have two lists ‘x’ and ‘y’ and we want to add each element of ‘x’ with \\neach element of ‘y’, we can write for loops as: \\nx = [10, 20, 30] \\ny = [1, 2, 3, 4] \\nlst=[] \\nfor i in x: \\n    for j in y: \\n        lst.append(i+j)'),\n",

We can write code as: \\nlst = [] \\nfor w in words: \\n    lst.append(w[0]) \\nNow, lst contains the following letters: \\n['A', 'G', 'B', 'O'] \\nThis task can be achieved through list comprehension as: \\nlst = [w[0] for w in words] \\nExample 5:  Let’s take two lists ‘num1’ and ‘num2’ with some numbers as: \\nnum1 = [1,2,3,4,5] \\nnum2 = [10,11,1,2] \\nWe want to create another list ‘num3’ with numbers present in ‘num1’ but not in ‘num2’. \\nWe can develop the logic like this: \\nnum3=[] \\nfor i in num1: \\n    if i not in num2: \\n        num3.append(i) \\nIf we display ‘num3’ we can see the following elements: \\n[3, 4, 5] \\nThe same can be achieved using list comprehension as: \\nnum3 = [i for i in num1 if i not in num2] \\nExample 6:  Like list comprehensions, it is also possible to create set comprehensions \\nand dictionary comprehensions in the same manner as discussed in the previous \\nexamples.

A dictionary uses curly braced {} to embed the \\nelements. We take a dictionary with hall ticket number and student name as: \\ndict = {1001: 'Pratap', 1002: 'Mohan', 1003: 'Ankita'} \\nHere, 1001 is hall ticket number of the student and ‘Pratap’ is the name of the student. \\nThe hall ticket number is called key and the name is called its value. We can create \\ndictionary comprehension to convert keys as values and vice versa as: \\ndict1 = {value: key for key,value in dict.items()} \\nHere, dict.items() represents all items in the dictionary in the form of key value pairs. In \\nthe above expression, we are writing value: key which is the reverse order for writing key \\nand value pairs. If we display ‘dict1’, it will show: \\n{'Pratap': 1001, 'Ankita': 1003, 'Mohan': 1002} \\nTuples \\nA tuple is a Python sequence which stores a group of elements or items. Tuples are \\nsimilar to lists but the main difference is tuples are immutable whereas lists are mutable. \\nSince tuples are immutable, once we create a tuple we cannot modify its elements. Hence \\nwe cannot perform operations like append(), extend(), insert(), remove(), pop() and clear() \\non tuples. Tuples are generally used to store data which should not be modified and \\nretrieve that data on demand.  \\nCreating Tuples \\nWe can create a tuple by writing elements separated by commas inside parentheses (). \\nThe elements can be of same datatype or different types. For example, to create an empty \\ntuple, we can simply write empty parenthesis, as: \\ntup1 = ()  # empty touple \\nIf we want to create a tuple with only one element, we can mention that element in \\nparentheses and after that a comma is needed, as: \\ntup2 = (10,)  # tuple with one element. Observe comma after the element. \\nHere is a tuple with different types of elements: \\ntup3 = (10, 20, -30.1, 40.5, 'Hyderabad', 'New Delhi') \\nWe can create a tuple with only one of type of elements also, like the following: \\ntup4 = (10, 20, 30)  # tuple with integers \\nIf we do not mention any brackets and write the elements separating them by commas, \\nthen they are taken by default as a tuple. See the following example: \\ntup5 = 1, 2, 3, 4  #no braces \\nThe point to remember is that if do not use any brackets, it will become a tuple and not a \\nlist or any other datatype.\"),\n",

This is done by converting a list into a \\ntuple using the tuple() function. Consider the following example: \\nlist = [1, 2, 3]   # take a list  \\ntpl = tuple(list)   # convert list into tuple \\nprint(tpl)   # display tuple \\nThe tuple is shown below: \\n(1, 2, 3) \\nAnother way to create a tuple is by using range() function that returns a sequence. To \\ncreate a tuple ‘tpl’ that contains numbers from 4 to 8 in steps of 2, we can use the range() \\nfunction along with tuple() function, as:   \\ntpl= tuple(range(4, 9, 2)) # numbers from 4 to 8 in steps of 2 \\nprint(tpl) \\nThe preceding statements will give: \\n(4, 6, 8) \\nAccessing the Tuple Elements \\nAccessing the elements from a tuple can be done using indexing or slicing. This is same \\nas that of a list. For example, let’s take a tuple by the name ‘tup’ as: \\ntup = (50,60,70,80,90,100) \\nIndexing represents the position number of the element in the tuple. Now, tup[0] \\nrepresents the 0th element, tup[1] represents the 1st element and so on.  \\nprint(tup[0]) \\nThe preceding will give: \\n50 \\nNow, if you write: \\nprint(tup [5]) \\nThen the following element appears: \\n100 \\nSimilarly, negative indexing is also possible. For example, tup[-1] indicates the last \\nelement and tup[-2] indicates the second element from the end and so on. Consider the \\nfollowing statement: \\nprint(tup[-1]) \\nThe preceding statement will give: \\n100 \\nIf you write, \\nprint(tup[-6])'),\n",

Slicing is done in the format: \\n[start: stop: stepsize]. Here, ‘start’ represents the position of the starting element and \\n‘stop’ represents the position of the ending element and the ‘stepsize’ in dicates the \\nincrementation. If the tuple contains ‘n’ elements, the default values will be 0 for ‘start’ \\nand n-1 for ‘stop’ and 1 for ‘stepsize’. For example, to extract all the elements from the \\ntuple, we can write: \\nprint(tup[:]) \\nThe elements of tuple appear: \\n(50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) \\nFor example, to extract the elements from 1st to 4th, we can write: \\nprint(tup[1:4]) \\nThe elements of tuple appear: \\n(60, 70, 80) \\nSimilarly, to extract every other element, i.e. alternate elements, we can write: \\nprint(tup[::2])   # here, start and stop assume default values.  \\nThe following output appears: \\n(50, 70, 90) \\nNegative values can be given in the slicing. If the ‘step size’ is negative, the elements are \\nextracted in reverse order as: \\nprint(tup[::-2]) \\nThe elements appear in the reverse order: \\n(100, 80, 60) \\nWhen the step size is not negative, the elements are extracted from left to right. In the \\nfollowing example, starting position -4 indicates the 4 th element from the last. Ending \\nposition -1 indicates the last element. Hence, the elements from 4 th to one element before \\nthe ending element (left to right) will be extracted.   \\nprint(tup[-4:-1])   # here, step size is 1 \\nThe following elements appear: \\n(70, 80, 90) \\nIn most of the cases, the extracted elements from the tuple should be stored in separate \\nvariables for further use. In the following example, we are extracting the first two \\nelements from the ‘student’ tuple and storing them into two variables. \\nstudent = (10, 'Vinay kumar', 50,60,65,61,70) \\nrno, name = student[0:2]\"),\n",

To retrieve the nested tuple, we can access  \\nit as an ordinary element as tup[5] as its index is 5. Now, consider the following \\nstatement: \\nprint(\\'Nested tuple= \\', tup[6]) \\nThe preceding statement will give the following output: \\nNested tuple=  (200, 201) \\nEvery nested tuple can represent a specific data record. For example, to store 4 \\nemployees data in ‘emp’ tuple, we can write: \\nemp = ((10, \"Vijay\", 9000.90), (20, \"Nihaar\", 5500.75), (30,   \\n  \"Vanaja\",8900.00), (40, \"Kapoor\", 5000.50))   \\nHere, ‘emp’ is the tuple name. It contains 4 nested tuples each of which represents the \\ndata of an employee. Every employee’s identification number, name and salary are stored \\nas a nested tuples.  \\nSorting Nested Tuples \\nTo sort a tuple, we can use sorted() function. This function sorts by default into \\nascending order. For example,  \\nprint(sorted(emp)) \\nwill sort the tuple ‘emp’ in ascending order of the 0 th element in the nested tuples, i.e. \\nidentificaton number. If we want to sort the tuple based on employee name, which is the \\n1st element in the nested tuples, we can use a lambda expression as: \\nprint(sorted(emp, key=lambda x: x[1]))  # sort on name \\nHere, key indicates the key for the sorted() function that tells on which element sorting \\nshould be done. The lambda function: lambda x: x[1] indicates that x[1] should be taken \\nas the key that is nothing but 1st element. If we want to sort the tuple based on salary, we \\ncan use the lambda function as: lambda x: x[2]. Consider Program 16. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 16: A Python program to sort a tuple with nested tuples.  \\n# sorting a tuple that contains tuples as elements \\n# take employee tuple with id number, name and salary \\nemp = ((10, \"Vijay\", 9000.90), (20, \"Nihaar\", 5500.75), (30,   \\n  \"Vanaja\",8900.00), (40, \"Kapoor\", 5000.50))   \\n \\nprint(sorted(emp))  # sorts by default on id \\nprint(sorted(emp, reverse=True))  # reverses on id \\nprint(sorted(emp, key=lambda x: x[1]))  # sort on name \\nprint(sorted(emp, key=lambda x: x[2]))  # sort on salary'),\n",

In Python, strings, \\nlists, tuples and dictionaries are very important sequence datatypes. \\n\\uf071 A list is similar to an array but a list can store different types of elements; whereas, \\nan array can store only one type of elements.  \\n\\uf071 The elements of a list are written inside square braces [].  \\n\\uf071 It is possible to create a list using range() function. This returns an iterable object \\nwhose elements form a sequence. Another function to create a list is list() function.  \\n\\uf071 Any sequence (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries) follow some operations like slicing, \\nindexing, finding length using len() function, concatenation, repetition, membership \\nand iteration operations.  \\n\\uf071 Lists are mutable. That means it is possible to modify or change the elements of a \\nlist.  \\n\\uf071 Aliasing a list represents giving a new name to the same list. Hence, if we change the \\naliased list, the changes will affect the original list and vice versa.  \\n\\uf071 Cloning a list can be done using slice operation. In cloning, if the cloned list is \\nmodified, the original list will not be modified as both will represent different copies of \\nlists. The same effect can be seen if we copy the list using copy() method.  \\n\\uf071 The intersection() method of sets is useful to filter the common elements from two \\nsets.  \\n\\uf071 A list within another list is called nested list. Nested lists are useful to create \\nmatrices.  \\n\\uf071 List comprehensions represent creation of new lists from an iterable object (like a list, \\nset, tuple, dictionary or range) that satisfies a given condition. \\n\\uf071 Tuples are similar to lists with the difference that tuples are immutable, whereas lists \\nare mutable. Since tuples are immutable, once we create a tuple, we cannot modify \\nits elements.'),\n",

If key is not \\nfound, it returns ‘v’. \\nitems() d.items() Returns an object that contains key -value pairs of ‘d’. \\nThe pairs are stored as tuples in the object.  \\nkeys() d.keys() Returns a sequence of keys from the dictionary ‘d’.  \\nvalues() d.values() Returns a  sequence of values from the dictionary ‘d’. \\nupdate() d.update(x) Adds all elements from dictionary ‘x’ to ‘d’.  \\npop() d.pop(k [,v]) Removes the key ‘k’ and its value from ‘d’ and returns \\nthe value. If key is not found, then the value ‘v’ is \\nreturned. If key is not found and ‘v’ is not mentioned \\nthen ‘KeyError’ is raised.  \\nsetdefault() d.setdefault(k [,v]) If key ‘k’ is found, its value is returned. If key is not \\nfound, then the k, v pair is stored into the dictionary \\n‘d’.  \\n \\nIn Program 2, we are going to retrieve keys from a dictionary using the keys() method. \\nThe keys() method returns dict_keys object that  contains only keys. We will also retrieve \\nvalues from the dictionary using values() method. This method returns all values in the \\nform of dict_values object. Similarly, the items() method can be used to retrieve all key -\\nvalue pairs into dict_items object.'),\n",

For example,  “Book” is the string and we are supposed to find the number of \\noccurrences of each letter in this string. It means the letter ‘B’ has occurred for 1 time, \\nthe letter ‘o’ occurred for 2 times and the letter ‘k’ occurred for 1 time.  In this program, \\nwe use get() method very effectively. Please recollect that the get() method is used on a \\ndictionary to retrieve the value by giving the key. If the key is not found in the dictionary, \\nthen it returns some default value. The format of the get() method is: \\ndict.get(x, 0) \\nThis statement says that if the key ‘x’ is found in the dictionary ‘dict’, then return its \\n‘value’ from the dictionary, else return 0. Now, consider the following code:  \\ndict = {}   # initially dict is empty  \\nstr = \"Book\"   # str indicates “Book” \\nfor x in str:   # x indicates each letter of “Book” \\n    dict[x] = dict.get(x, 0) + 1 \\nIn the preceding code, the last statement is very important.   \\ndict[x] = dict.get(x, 0) + 1 \\nObserve the right hand side expression with get() method. It says if ‘x’ (this is the letter of \\nthe string) is found in the dictionary ‘dict’, then return its value, else return 0. But we \\nadded ‘1’ to the value returned by get() method and hence, if ‘x’ is not found, it returns 1. \\nIf ‘x’ is found then it returns the value of ‘x’ plus 1.  \\nObserve the left side expression, i.e. dict[x]. This represents ‘x’ is stored as key in the \\ndictionary. Whatever the value returned by the right side expression will be stored into \\nthat dictionary as value for the key ‘x’. That means:  \\ndict[x] = value returned by get() + 1 \\nLet’s take the first letter of the string, i.e. ‘B’. Since the dictionary is initially empty, there \\nare no elements in it and hence ‘B’ is not found in the dictionary. So , dict.get(x, 0) + 1 \\nreturns 1. At the left side, we are having  dict[x]. It represents dict[‘B’]. Here, ‘B’ is taken \\nas key. So, the statement becomes: \\ndict[‘B’] = 1 \\nIt means ‘B’ is stored as key and 1 is stored as its value into the dictionary ‘dict’. So the \\ndictionary contains a pair of elements as: {‘B’: 1}. In the  next step, ‘o’ is the letter for \\nwhich the get() method searches in the dictionary. It is not found in the ‘dict’ and hence 1 \\nis returned. So, \\ndict[‘o’] = 1 \\nThis will store the new key – value pair, i.e. ‘o’ and 1 into the ‘dict’ and hence the \\ndictionary contains:  \\n{‘B’: 1, ‘o’: 1}.'),\n",

Lambda functions are written using a \\nsingle statement and hence look like expressions. Lambda functions are written without \\nusing ‘def’ keyword. They are useful to perform some calculations or processing easily. \\nFor example,  \\nf = lambda x, y: x+y \\nThe above expression is a lambda function with 2 arguments, x and y. After colon (:), we \\nwrote the body, i.e. x+y. this is the value returned by the lambda function. At the time of \\ncalling this function, we are supposed to pass 2 values for x and y as: f(10, 15). This will \\nreturn 25 as re sult. For understanding lambdas, kindly refer to the chapter on \\n‘Functions’.  \\nLet’s take an example dictionary as: \\ncolors = {10: \"Red\", 35: \"Green\", 15: \"Blue\", 25: \"White\"} \\nHere, color code and its name are given as key-value pairs.  Suppose we want to sort this \\ndictionary into ascending order of keys, i.e. on color codes, we can use sorted() function \\nin the following format: \\nsorted(elements, key = color code) \\nHere, elements of the dictionary can be accessed using the colors.items() method. A key \\ncan be prescribed using a lambda function as: \\nkey = lambda t: t[0] \\nHere, ‘t’ is the argument for the lambda function and t[0] is the value returned by the \\nfunction. Since we are suppo sed to sort the dictionary, we should pass the entire \\ndictionary to lambda function. So,  ‘t’ represents the dictionary that is passed to the \\nfunction and t[0] represents the 0 th element in the dictionary, i.e. color code. So, the \\nsorted() function can be written as: \\nsorted(colors.items(), key = lambda t: t[0]) \\nThis will sort all the elements of the dictionary by taking color code (indicated by t[0]) as \\nthe key. If we want to sort the dictionary based on color name, then we can write:  \\nsorted(colors.items(), key = lambda t: t[1]) \\nThis will sort the elements of the dictionary by taking color name (indicated by t[1]) as the \\nkey. Consider Program 8 to understand how to sort the elements of a dictionary.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 8: A Python program to sort the element s of a dictionary based on a key or \\nvalue. \\n# Sorting a dictionary by key or value \\n# take a dictionary \\ncolors = {10: \"Red\", 35: \"Green\", 15: \"Blue\", 25: \"White\"}'),\n",

The dictionary should look something like this: \\nd = {\"USA\" : \\'Washington\\', \"India\" : \\'New Delhi\\' , \"Germany\" :   \\n  \\'Berlin\\', \"France\" : \\'Paris\\'} \\nThere are two steps involved to convert the lists into a dictionary. The first step is to \\ncreate a ‘zip’ class object by passing the two lists to zip() function as: \\nz = zip(countries, cities) \\nThe zip() function is useful to convert the sequences into a zip class object. There may be \\n1 or more sequences that can be passed to zip() function. Of course, we passed only 2 \\nlists to zip() function in the above statement. The resultant zip object is ‘z’.  \\nThe second step is to convert the zip object into a dictionary by using dict() function.  \\nd = dict(z) \\nHere, the 0 th element of z is taken as ‘key’ and 1st element is converted into its ‘value’. \\nSimilarly, 2nd element becomes ‘key’ and 3rd one becomes its ‘value’, etc. They are stored \\ninto the dictionary ‘d’. If we display ‘d’, we can see the following dictionary: \\n{\\'India\\': \\'New Delhi\\', \\'USA\\': \\'Washington\\', \\'Germany\\': \\'Berlin\\',  \\n  \\'France\\': \\'Paris\\'} \\n \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 9: A Python program to convert the elements of two lists into key-value pairs of \\na dictionary. \\n# converting lists into a dictionary \\n# take two separate lists with elements \\ncountries = [\"USA\", \"India\", \"Germany\", \"France\"] \\ncities = [\\'Washington\\', \\'New Delhi\\', \\'Berlin\\', \\'Paris\\']'),\n",

Let’s take an example string: \\nstr = \"Vijay=23,Ganesh=20,Lakshmi=19,Nikhil=22\" \\nThis string ‘str’ contains names and their ages. Each pair is separated by a comma ( , ). \\nAlso, each name and age are separated by equals ( = ) symbol. To convert such a string \\ninto a dictionary, we have to follow 3 steps. First, we should split the string into pieces \\nwhere a comma is found using split() method and then brake the string at equals ( = ) \\nsymbol. This can be done using a for loop as: \\nfor x in str.split(\\',\\'): \\n    y= x.split(\\'=\\') \\nEach piece of the string is available in ‘y’. The second step is to store these pieces into a \\nlist ‘lst’ using append() method as: \\nlst.append(y) \\nThe third step is to convert the list into a dictionary ‘d’ using dict() function as: \\nd = dict(lst) \\nNow, this dictionary ‘d’ contains the elements as: \\n{\\'Vijay\\': \\'23’, \\'Ganesh\\': \\'20\\', \\'Lakshmi\\': \\'19\\', \\'Nikhil\\': \\'22\\'} \\nPlease observe that this dictionary contains all elements as strings only. See first pair: \\n‘Vijay’: ‘23’. Here, ‘Vijay’ is string and his age ‘23’ is also stored as string. If we want we \\ncan convert this ‘23’ into an integer using int() function.

It means the \\nelements are not stored into the same order as they were entered into the dictionary. \\nSometimes this becomes a problem. For example, take an employee database in a \\ncompany which stores employees details depending on their seniority, i.e. senior most \\nemployee’s data may be in the beginning of the database. If the employees’ details are \\nstored in a dictionary, this database will not show the employees details in the same \\norder. When the employees’ details are changed, the seniority is disturbed and the data of \\nthe employee who joined the company first may not appear in the beginning of the \\ndictionary. In such a case, the solution is to use ordered dictionaries.  \\nAn ordered dic tionary is a dictionary but it will keep the order of the elements. The \\nelements are stored and maintained in the same order as they were entered into the \\nordered dictionary.  We can create an ordered dictionary using the OrderedDict() method of \\n‘collections’ module. So, first we should import this method from collections module, as: \\nfrom collections import OrderedDict \\nOnce this is done, we can create an ordered dictionary with the name ‘d’ as: \\nd = OrderedDict()    \\nWe can store the key and values into ‘d’, as: \\nd[10] = 'A' \\nd[11] = 'B' \\nd[12] = 'C' \\nd[13] = 'D' \\nHere, 10 is the key and ‘A’ is its value and so on. This order is not disturbed as ‘d’ is \\nordered dictionary. When we display the key – value pairs from the dictionary ‘d’, we can \\nsee the same order. This is shown in Program 12.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 12: A Python program to create a dictionary that does not change the order of \\nelements. \\n# create an ordered dictionary \\nfrom collections import OrderedDict \\nd = OrderedDict()   # d is ordered dictionary\"),\n",

When there is another task to be added to the \\nsoftware, he would be writing another set of functions. This means his concentration will \\nbe only on achieving the tasks. He perceives the entire system as fragments of several \\ntasks. Whenever he wants to perform a new task, he would be writing a new set of \\nfunctions. Thus there is no reusability of an already existing code. A new task every time \\nrequires developing the code from the scratch. This wastes programmer’s time and effort.'),\n",

Hence, an error in the software needs \\nexamination of all the functions. Thus debugging or removing errors will become difficult. \\nAny updations to the software will also be difficult.  \\nWhen the software is developed, naturally code size will also be increased. It has been \\nobserved in most of the software developed following the Procedure Oriented approach \\nthat when the code size exceeds 10,000 lines and before reaching 100,000 lines, \\nsuddenly at a particular point, the programmers st art losing control on the code. This \\nmeans, the programmers could not understand the exact behavior of the code and could \\nneither debug it, nor extend it. This posed many problems, especially when the software \\nwas constructed to handle bigger and complex s ystems. For example, to create software \\nto send satellites into the sky and control their operations from the ground stations, we \\nmay have to write millions of lines of code. In such systems, Procedure Oriented \\napproach fails and programmers realized the need of another approach.   \\nThere is another problem with Procedure Oriented approach. Programming in this \\napproach is not developed from human being’s life. Statements, functions or procedures \\nnever reflect the human beings. So, from the human beings’ poin t of view, they are \\nunnatural. Unnatural activities are difficult to perform. For example, as human beings, \\nwe can walk or run. But, if we are asked to fly like birds; that would become impossible \\nfor us since flying is not natural for human beings. In the  same way, if programming is \\ndeveloped from human beings’ life, we can adapt to it easily. This idea forced computer \\nscientists to develop a new approach that would be closer to human beings’ life.  \\nDue to the preceding reasons, computer scientists felt the need of a new approach where \\nprogramming will have several modules. Each module represents a ‘class’ and the classes \\ncan be reusable and hence maintenance of code will become easy. When there is an \\nerror, it is possible to debug only on that class where error occurred without disturbing \\nthe other classes. This approach is suitable not only to develop bigger and complex \\napplications but also to manage them easily. Moreover, this approach is built from a \\nsingle root concept ‘object’, which represents anything that physically exists in this world. \\nIt means that all human beings are objects. All animals are objects. All existing things \\nwill become objects. This new approach is called ‘Object Oriented Approach’. \\nProgramming in this approach is called Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS). \\nIn OOPS, everything is an object. In real life, some objects will have similar behavior. For \\nexample, all birds have similar behavior like having two wings, two legs, etc. Also, all \\nbirds have the ability to fly in the sky.  Such objects with similar behavior belong to the \\nsame class. So, a class represents common behavior of a group of objects. Since a class \\nrepresents behavior, it does not exist physically. But objects exist physically. For \\nexample, bird is a class; whereas , sparrow, pigeon, crow and peacock are objects of the \\nbird class. Similarly, human being is a class and Arjun, Krishna, Sita are objects of the \\nhuman being class.'),\n",

This makes programs \\nlengthy. For example, we have to write all the statements of the program inside a class \\nand then create objects to the class. Then use the features of the class through objects. \\nThis type of programming requires much code to perform a simple task like adding two \\nnumbers. Also, the program execution takes more time. So, for simple tasks, it is still \\nbetter to go for procedure oriented approach which offers less code and more speed. For \\nexample, a C program executes faster than its equiva lent program written in Python or \\nJava!   \\nEven though, Python is an object oriented programming language like Java, it does not \\nforce the programmers to write programs in complete object oriented way. Unlike Java, \\nPython has a blend of both the object orie nted and procedure oriented features. Hence, \\nPython programmers can write programs using procedure oriented approach (like C) or \\nobject oriented approach (like Java) depending on their requirements. This is definitely \\nan advantage for Python programmers! \\nFeatures of Object Oriented Programming System (OOPS) \\nThere are five important features related to Object Oriented Programming System. They \\nare: \\n\\uf071 Classes and objects \\n\\uf071 Encapsulation \\n\\uf071 Abstraction \\n\\uf071 Inheritance \\n\\uf071 Polymorphism \\nLet’s move further to have clear understanding of each of these features. \\nClasses and Objects \\nThe entire OOPS methodology has been derived from a single root concept called ‘object’. \\nAn object is anything that really exists in the world and can be distinguished from others. \\nThis definition specifies that everything in this world is an object. For example, a table, a \\nball, a car, a dog, a person, etc. will come under objects. Then what is not an object? If \\nsomething does not really exist, then it is not an object. For example, our thoughts,  \\nimagination, plans, ideas etc. are not objects, because they do not physically exist.'),\n",

The behavior of an object is represented by attributes \\nand actions. For example, let’s take a person whose name is ‘Raju’. Raju  is an object \\nbecause he exists physically. He has attributes like name, age, sex, etc. These attributes \\ncan be represented by variables in our programming. For example, ’name’ is a string type \\nvariable, ‘age’ is an integer type variable.  \\nSimilarly, Raju can perform some actions like talking, walking, eating and sleeping. We \\nmay not write code for such actions in programming. But, we can consider calculations \\nand processing of data as actions. These actions are performed by methods. We should \\nunderstand th at a function written inside a class is called a method. So an object \\ncontains variables and methods.  \\nIt is possible that some objects may have similar behavior. Such objects belong to same \\ncategory called a ‘class’. For example, not only Raju, but all th e other persons have \\nvarious common attributes and actions. So they are all objects of same class, ‘Person’. \\nNow observe that the ‘Person’ will not exist physically but only Raju, Ravi, Sita, etc. exist \\nphysically. This means, a class is a group name and does not exist physically, but objects \\nexist physically. See Figure 12.3: \\n \\nFigure 12.3:  Person Class and Raju Object \\nTo understand a class, take a pen and paper and write down all the attributes and \\nactions of any person. The paper contains the model that depicts a person, so it is called \\na class. We can find a person with the name ‘Raju’, who got all the attributes and actions \\nas written on the paper. So ‘Raju’ becomes an object of the class, Person. This gives a \\ndefinition for the class. A class is a mod el or blueprint for creating objects. By following \\nthe class, one can create objects. So we can say, whatever is there in the class, will be \\nseen in its objects also.'),\n",

To write a class, we can write all t he \\ncharacteristics of objects which should follow the class. These characteristics will guide \\nus to create objects. A class and its objects are almost the same with the difference that a \\nclass does not exist physically, while an object does. For example, l et’s say we want to \\nconstruct a house. First of all, we will go to an architect who provides a plan. This plan is \\nonly an idea and exists on paper. This is called a class. However, based on this plan, if we \\nconstruct the house, it is called an object since  it exists physically. So, we can say that \\nwe can create objects from the class. An object does not exist without a class. But a class \\ncan exist without any objects.  \\nLet’s take another example. Flower is a class but if we take Rose, Lily, and Jasmine – \\nthey are all objects of flower class. The class flower does not exist physically but its \\nobjects, like Rose, Lily and Jasmine exist physically. \\nLet’s take another example. We want a table made by a carpenter. First of all, the \\ncarpenter takes a paper and wri tes the measurements regarding length, breadth and \\nheight of the table.  He may also draw a picture on the paper that works like a model for \\ncreating the original table. This plan or model is called a ‘class’. Following this model, he \\nmakes the table that can be used by us. This table is called an ‘object’. To make the \\ntable, we need material, i.e. wood. The wood represents the memory allotted by the PVM \\nfor the objects. Remember, objects are created on heap memory by PVM at run time. See \\nFigure 12.4. It is  also possible to create several objects (tables) from the same class \\n(plan). An object cannot exist without a class. But a class can exist without any object. \\nWe can think that a class is a model and if it physically appears, then it becomes an \\nobject. So an object is called ‘instance’ (physical form) of a class.   \\n \\nFigure 12.4:  Creation of a Class and Object \\nCreating Classes and Objects in Python \\nLet’s create a class with the name Person for which Raju and Sita are objects.

We can call the talk() method to display Raju’s details as: \\np1.talk() \\nEncapsulation \\nEncapsulation is a mechanism where the data (variables) and the code (methods) that act \\non the data will bind together. For example, if we take a class, we write the variables and \\nmethods inside the class. Thus, class is binding them together. So class is an example for \\nencapsulation.  \\nThe variables and methods of a class are called ‘members’ of the class. All the members \\nof a class are by default available outside the class. That means they are public by \\ndefault. Public means available to other programs and classes. Python  follows Uniform \\nAccess Principle that says that in OOPS, all the members of the class whether they are \\nvariables or methods should be accessible in a uniform manner. So, Python variables and \\nmethods are available outside alike. That means both are public by default.  Usually, in \\nC++ and Java languages, the variables are kept private, that means they are not available \\noutside the class and the methods are kept public meaning that they are available to \\nother programs. But in Python, both the variables and methods are public by default.  \\nEncapsulation isolates the members of a class from the members of another class. The \\nreason is when objects are created, each object shares different memory and hence there \\nwill not be any overwriting of data. This gives an advantage to the programmer to use \\nsame names for the members of two different classes. For example, a programmer can \\ndeclare and use the variables like ‘id’, ‘name’, and ‘address’ in  different classes like \\nEmployee, Customer, or Student classes.\"),\n",

Hence data and code are \\nbundled up together in the class. For example, we can write a Student class with ‘id’ and \\n‘name as attributes along with the display() method that displays this data. This Student \\nclass becomes an example for encapsulation.  \\n# a class is an example for encapsulation \\nclass Student: \\n    # to declare and initialize the variables \\n    def __init__(self): \\n        self.id = 10 \\n        self.name = 'Raju' \\n     \\n    # display students details \\n    def display(self): \\n        print(self.id) \\n        print(self.name) \\nObserve the first method: def __init__(self). This is called a special function since its name \\nis starting and ending with two underscores. If a variable or method name starts and \\nends with two underscores, they are built-in variables or methods which are defined for a \\nspecific purpose. The programmer should not create any variable or method like them. It \\nmeans we should not create variables or methods with two underscores before and after \\ntheir names.   \\nThe purpose of the special method def __init__(self) is to declare and initialize the \\ninstance variables of a class. Instance variables are the variables whose copy is available \\nin the object (or instance). The first parameter for this method is ‘self’ that represents the \\nobject (or instance) of the present class. So, self.id refers to the variab le in the object. In \\nthe Student class, we have written another method by the name display() that displays \\nthe instance variables.  \\nAbstraction  \\nThere may be a lot of data, a class contains and the user does not need the entire data. \\nThe user requires only  some part of the available data. In this case, we can hide the \\nunnecessary data from the user and expose only that data that is of interest to the user. \\nThis is called abstraction.  \\nA good example for abstraction is a car. Any car will have some parts lik e engine, \\nradiator, battery, mechanical and electrical equipment etc. The user of the car (driver) \\nshould know how to drive the car and does not require any knowledge of these parts. For \\nexample driver is never bothered about how the engine is designed and the internal parts \\nof the engine. This is why the car manufacturers hide these parts from the driver in a \\nseparate panel, generally at the front of the car.\"),\n",

He should not be entitled to see the sensitive data like the staff salaries, profit \\nor loss of the bank, interest amount paid by the bank, loans amount to be recovered, etc. \\nHence, such sensitive data can be abstracted from the clerk’s view. The bank manager \\nmay, however, require the sensitive data and so it will be provided to the manager.  \\nAbstraction in Python \\nIn languages like Java, we have keywords like private, protected and public to implement \\nvarious levels of abstraction. These keywords are called access specifiers.  In Python, \\nsuch words are not available. Everything written in th e class will come under public. \\nThat means everything written in the class is available outside the class to other people. \\nSuppose, we do not want to make a variable available outside the class or to other \\nmembers inside the class, we can write the variabl e with two double scores before it as: \\n__var. This is like a private variable in Python. In the following example, ‘y’ is a private \\nvariable since it is written as: __y.  \\nclass Myclass: \\n    # this is constructor. \\n    def __init__(self):           \\n        self.__y = 3   # this is private variable \\nNow, it is not possible to access the variable from within the class or out of the class as: \\nm = Myclass() \\nprint(m.y)   # error \\nThe preceding print() statement displays error message as: AttributeError: ‘Myclass’ \\nobject has no attribute ‘y’. Even though, we cannot access the private variable in this \\nway, it is possible to access it in the format: instancename.__Classname__var. That \\nmeans we are using Classname differently to access the private variable. This is calle d \\nname mangling.  In name mangling, we have to use one underscore before the classname \\nand two underscores after the classname. Like this, using the names differently to access \\nthe private variables is called name mangling.  For example, to display a priva te variable \\n‘y’ value, we can write: \\nprint(m._Myclass__y)   # display private variable y \\nThe same statement can be written inside the method as: print(self._Myclass__z). When \\nwe use single underscore before a variable as _var, then that variable or object will not be \\nimported into other files. The following code represents the public and private variables \\nand how to access them.  \\n# understanding public and private variables \\nclass Myclass: \\n    # this is constructor. \\n    def __init__(self):           \\n        self.x = 1   # public var \\n        self.__y = 2  # private var'),\n",

A good example for Inheritance in \\nnature is parents producing the children and children inheriting the qualities of the \\nparents.  \\nLet’s take a class A with some members i.e., variables and methods. If we feel another \\nclass B wants almost same members, then we can derive or create class B from A as:  \\nclass B(A):    \\nNow, all the features of A are available to B. If an object to B is created, it contains all the \\nmembers of class A and also its own members. Thus, the programmer can access and \\nuse all the members of both the classes A and B.  Thus, class B becomes more useful. \\nThis is called inheritance. The original class (A) is called the base class or super class and \\nthe derived class (B) is called the sub class or derived class. \\nThere are three advantages of inheritance. First, we can create more useful classes \\nneeded by the application (software). Next, the process of creating the new classes is very \\neasy, since they are built upon already existing classes. The last, but very important \\nadvantage is managing the code becomes easy, since the programmer creates several \\nclasses in a hierarchical manner, and segregates the code into several modules.  \\nAn Example for Inheritance in Python \\nHere, we take a class A with two variables ‘a’ and ’b’ and a method, method1(). Since all \\nthese members are needed by another class B, we extend class B from A. We want some \\nadditional members in B, for example a va riable ‘c’ and a method, method2(). So, these \\nare written in B. Now remember, class B can use all the members of both A and B. This \\nmeans the variables ‘a’,’b’,’c ‘and also the methods method1() and method2() are available \\nto class B. That means all the members of A are inherited by B.  \\n# Creating class B from class A \\nclass A :     \\n    a = 1 \\n    b = 2'),\n",

Thus, polymorphism represents the ability to assume several \\ndifferent forms. In programming, if an object or method is exhibiting different behavior in \\ndifferent contexts, it is called polymorphic nature.  \\nPolymorphism provides flexibility in writing programs in such a way that the programmer \\nuses same method call to perform different operations depending on the requirement.  \\nExample Code for Polymorphism in Python: \\nWhen a function can perform different tasks, we can say that it is exhibiting \\npolymorphism. A simple example is to write a function as: \\ndef add(a, b): \\n    print(a+b) \\nSince in Python, there the variables are not declared explicitly, we are passing two \\nvariables ‘a’, and ‘b’ to add() function where they are added. While calling this function, if \\nwe pass two integers like 5 and 15, then this function displays 15. If we pass two strings, \\nthen the same function concatenates or joins those strings. That means the same \\nfunction is adding two integers or concatenating two strings. Since the function is \\nperforming two different tasks, it is said to exhibit polymorphism. No w, consider the \\nfollowing example: \\n# a function that exhibits polymorphism \\ndef add(a, b): \\n    print(a+b) \\n \\n# call add() and pass two integers \\nadd(5, 10)  # displays 15 \\n \\n# call add() and pass two strings \\nadd(\"Core\", \"Python\")  # displays CorePython'),\n",

After this, we should write \\nthe class name. So, ‘Student’ is our class name. Generally, a class name should start \\nwith a capital letter, hence ‘S’ is capital in ‘Student’. In the class, we write attributes \\nand methods. Since in Python, we cannot declare variables, we have written the \\nvariables inside a special method, i.e. __init__(). This method is useful to initialize the \\nvariables. Hence, the name ‘init’. The method name has two underscores before and \\nafter. This indicates that this method is internally defined and we cannot call this \\nmethod explicitly.

Let’s \\nhave more clarity on these two concepts. \\nThe Self Variable \\n‘self’ is a default variable that contains the memory address o f the instance of the current \\nclass. So, we can use ‘self’ to refer to all the instance variables and instance methods.  \\nWhen an instance to the class is created, the instance name contains the memory \\nlocation of the instance.

That memory location is by default available to the talk() method \\nthrough ‘self’.  \\nConstructor \\nA constructor is a special method that is used to initialize the instance variables of a \\nclass. In the constructor, we create the instance variables and initialize them with some \\nstarting values. The first parameter of the constructor will be ‘self’ variable that contains \\nthe memory address of the instance. For example,  \\ndef __init__(self):           \\n    self.name = ‘Vishnu’ \\n    self.marks = 900 \\nHere, the constructor has only one parameter, i.e. ‘self’.

We can \\nwrite a constructor with some parameters in addition to ‘self’ as:  \\ndef __init__(self, n = ‘’, m=0):           \\n    self.name = n \\n    self.marks = m \\nHere, the formal arguments are ‘n’ and ‘m’ whose default values are given as ‘’ (None) and \\n0 (zero). Hence, if we do not pass any values to constructor at the time of creating an \\ninstance, the default values of these formal arguments are stored into name and marks \\nvariables. For example,   \\ns1 = Student() \\nSince we are not passing any values to the instance, None and zero are stored into name \\nand marks. Suppose, we create an instance as: \\ns1 = Student(‘Lakshmi Roy’, 880) \\nIn this case, we are passing two actual arguments: ‘Lakshmi Roy’ and 880 to the Student \\ninstance. Hence these values are sent to the arguments ‘n’ and ‘m’ and from there stored \\ninto name and marks variables. We can understand this concept from Program 2. \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 2: A Python program to create Student class with a constructor having more \\nthan one parameter.  \\n# instance vars and instance method - v.20 \\nclass Student: \\n    # this is constructor. \\n    def __init__(self, n = '', m=0):           \\n        self.name = n \\n        self.marks = m \\n \\n    # this is an instance method. \\n    def display(self):           \\n        print('Hi', self.name)  \\n        print('Your marks', self.marks) \\n \\n# constructor is called without any arguments \\ns = Student() \\ns.display() \\nprint('------------------') \\n \\n# constructor is called with 2 arguments \\ns1 = Student('Lakshmi Roy', 880) \\ns1.display() \\nprint('------------------') \\nOutput: \\nC:\\\\>python cl.py \\nHi  \\nYour marks 0\"),\n",

It is also possible to access the instance variables from outside \\nthe class, as: instancename.variable, e.g. s1.x. \\nUnlike instance variables, class variables are the variables whose single copy is available \\nto all the instances of the class.

When we \\nmodify the copy of ‘x’ in any instance using a class method, the modified copy is sent to \\nthe other two instances. This can be easily grasped from Program 4.

We can access the class \\nvariables using the class methods as: cls.variable.

In the following code, ‘n’ is a class variable in \\nthe Student class. So, in the class namespace, the name ‘n’ is mapped or linked to 10 as \\nshown Figure 13.2.

For \\nexample, if we write class B inside class A, then B is called inner class or nested class. \\nInner classes are useful when we want to sub group the data of a class. For example, let’s \\ntake a person’s data like name, age, date of birth etc. Here, name contains a single value \\nlike ‘Charles’, age contains a single value like ‘30’ but the date of birth does not contain a \\nsingle value. Rather, it contains three values like date, month and year. So, we need to \\ntake these three values as a sub group. Hence it is better to write date of birth as a \\nseparate class Dob inside the Person class. This Dob will contain instance variables dd, \\nmm and yy which represent the date of birth details of the person.  \\nGenerally, the inner class object is created within the outer class. Let’s take Person class \\nas outer class and Dob as inner class. Dob class object is created in the constructor of \\nthe Person class as:  \\nclass Person: \\n    def __init__(self): \\n        self.name = 'Charles'   \\n        self.db = self.Dob()   # this is Dob object \\nIn the preceding code, ‘db’ represents the inner class object. When the outer class object \\nis created, it contains a sub object that is inner class object. Hence, we can refer outer \\nclass and inner class members as: \\np = Person()   # create outer class object  \\np.display()   # call outer class method \\nprint(p.name)   # refer to outer class instance variable\"),\n",

The original class, i.e. Teacher class is called base class or \\nsuper class and the newly created class, i.e. the Student class is called the sub class or \\nderived class. So, how can we define inheritance? Deriving new classes from the existing \\nclasses such that the new classes inherit all the members of the existing classes, is called \\ninheritance. The syntax for inheritance is: \\nclass Subclass(Baseclass):   \\nThe next question is why the base class members are automatically available to sub \\nclass? When an object to Student class is created, it contains a copy of Teacher class \\nwithin it. This means there is a relation between the Teacher class and Student class \\nobjects. This is the reason Teacher class members are available to Student class. Note \\nthat we do not create Teacher class object, but still a copy of it is available to Student \\nclass object. Please see the object diagram of Student class in Figure 14.2. We can \\nunderstand that all the members (i.e., variables and methods) of Teacher class as well as \\nStudent class are available in the Student class object.  \\nThen, what is the advantage of inheritance? Please look at Student class version 1 and \\nStudent class version 2. Clearly, second version is smaller and easier to develop. By \\nusing inheritance, a programmer can develop the classes very easily. Hence \\nprogrammer’s productivity is increased. Productivity is a term that refers to the cod e \\ndeveloped by the programmer in a given span of time. If the programmer used \\ninheritance, he will be able to develop more code in less time. So, his productivity is \\nincreased. This will increase the overall productivity of the organization, which means \\nmore profits for the organization and better growth for the programmer.  \\nIn inheritance, we always create only the sub class object. Generally, we do not create \\nsuper class object. The reason is clear. Since all the members of the super class are \\navailable to sub class, when we create an object, we can access the members of both the \\nsuper and sub classes. But if we create an object to super class, we can access only the \\nsuper class members and not the sub class members.\"),\n",

For this purpose, we should call the constructor of the \\nsuper class from the constructor of the sub class using the super() method. \\nThe super() Method \\nsuper() is a built-in method which is useful to call the super class constructor or methods \\nfrom the sub class. Any constructor written in the super class is not available to the sub \\nclass if the sub class has a constructor. Then how can we initialize the super class \\ninstance variables and use them in the sub class? This is done by calling the super class \\nconstructor using the super() method from inside the sub class constructor.   super() is a \\nbuilt-in method in Python that contains the history of super class methods. Hence, we \\ncan use super() to refer to super class constructor and methods from  a sub class. So \\nsuper() can be used as: \\nsuper().__init__()     # call super class constructor \\nsuper().__init__(arguments)# call super class constructor and pass  \\n                        # arguments  \\nsuper().method()   # call super class method \\nWhen there is a constructor with parameters in the super class, we have to create another \\nconstructor with parameters in the sub class and call the super class constructor using \\nsuper() from the sub class constructor. In the following example, we are calling the super \\nclass constructor and passing ‘property’ value to it from the sub class constructor.  \\n# this is sub class constructor \\ndef __init__(self, property1=0, property=0): \\n    super().__init__(property)  # send property value to superclass  \\n                                # constructor \\n    self.property1= property1   # store property1 value into subclass  \\n                                # variable \\nAs shown in the preceding code, the sub class constructor has 2 parameters. They are \\n‘property1’ and ‘property’. So, when we create an object (or instance) to sub class, we \\nshould pass two values, as: \\ns = Son(200000.00, 800000.00) \\nNow, the first value 200000 is stored into ‘property1’ and the second value 800000.00 is \\nstored into ‘property’. Afterwards, this ‘property’ value is sent to super class constructor \\nin the first statement of the sub class constructor.  This is shown in Program 8.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 8: A Python program to call the super class constructor in the sub class using \\nsuper(). \\n# accessing base class constructor in sub class \\nclass Father:'),\n",

The \\nmembers of the super class are reusable in the sub classes. Let’s remember that all \\nclasses in Python are built from a single super class called ‘object’. If a programmer \\ncreates his own classes, by default object class will become super class for them \\ninternally. This is the reason, sometimes while creating any new class, we mention the \\nobject class name in parentheses as: \\nclass Myclass(object):  \\nHere, we are indicating that object is the super class for Myclass. Of course, writing \\nobject class name is not mandatory and hence the preceding code is equivalent to \\nwriting: \\nclass Myclass:  \\nNow, coming to the types of inheritance, there are mainly 2 types of inheritance available. \\nThey are: \\n\\uf071 Single inheritance \\n\\uf071 Multiple inheritance \\nSingle Inheritance \\nDeriving one or more sub classes from a single base class is called ‘single inheritance’. In \\nsingle inheritance, we always have only one base class, but there can be n number of sub \\nclasses derived from it. For example, ‘Bank’ is a single base class from where we derive \\n‘AndhraBank’ and ‘StateBank’ as sub classes. This is called single inheritance . Consider \\nFigure 14.3.  It is convention that we should use the arrow head towards the base class \\n(i.e. super class) in the inheritance diagrams.'),\n",

So, the search will continue down to right hand side class of object \\nclass. That is class B. Hence B’s constructor is executed and ‘b’ is displayed. After that \\nthe statement super().__init__()  will attempt to execute constructor of B’s super class. \\nThat is nothing but ‘object’ class. Since object class is already visit ed, the search stops \\nhere. As a result the output will be ‘c’, ’a’, ’b’. Searching in this manner for constructors \\nor methods is called Method Resolution Order(MRO).  \\nMethod Resolution Order (MRO) \\nIn the multiple inheritance scenario, any specified attribute or method is searched first in \\nthe current class. If not found, the search continues into parent classes in depth-first, \\nleft to right fashion without searching the same class twice. Searching in this way is \\ncalled Method Resolution Order (MRO). There are three principles followed by MRO.  \\n\\uf071 The first principle is to search for the sub class before going for its base classes. Thus \\nif class B is inherited from A, it will search B first and then goes to A.  \\n\\uf071 The second principle is that when a class is inherited from several classes, it searches \\nin the order from left to right in the base classes. For example, if class C is inherited \\nfrom A and B as class C(A,B), then first it will search in A and then in B.    \\n\\uf071 The third principle is that it will not visit any class more than once. That means a \\nclass in the inheritance hierarchy is traversed only once exactly.  \\nUnderstanding MRO gives us clear idea regarding which classes are executed and in \\nwhich sequence. We can easily estimate the output when several base classes are \\ninvolved. To know the MRO, we can use mro() method as: \\nClassname.mro() \\nThis returns the sequence of execution of the classes, starting from the class with which \\nthe method is called. As depicted in Figure 14.6, we are going to create inheritance \\nhierarchy with several classes. The sub class for all these classes is P. This is shown in \\nProgram 14.'),\n",

Python’s type system is ‘dynamic’ since the type of a variable is not explicitly \\ndeclared, but it changes with the content being stored.  \\nSimilarly, if we want to call a method on an object, we do not need to check the type of \\nthe object and we do not need to check whether that method really belongs to that object \\nor not.

We see method overloading in the languages like Java. For example, we call \\na method as: \\nsum(10, 15) \\nsum(10, 15, 20) \\nIn the first call, we are passing two arguments and in the second call, we are passing \\nthree arguments. It means, the sum() method is performing two distinct operations: \\nfinding sum of two numbers or sum of three numbers. This is called method overloading. \\nIn Java, to achieve this, we write two sum() methods with different number of parameters \\nas:  \\nsum(int a, int b) {} \\nsum(int a, int b, int c) {} \\nSince same name is given for these two methods, the user feels that the same method is \\nperforming the two operations. This is how the method overloading is done in Java.  \\nMethod overloading is not available in Python. Writing more than one method with the \\nsame name is not possible in Python. So, we can achieve method overloading by writing \\nsame method with several parameters. The method performs the operation depending on \\nthe number of arguments passed in the method call. For example, we can write a sum() \\nmethod with default value ‘None’ for the arguments as:\"),\n",

For \\nthis, we write a method as:  steering() \\n How do we steer the car? All the cars do not have same mechanism for steering. \\nMaruti cars have manual steering. Santro cars have power steering.

Applying brakes is an action and hence it can be \\nrepresented as a method, as: braking() \\n How do we apply brakes? All cars do not have same mechanism for brakes. Maruti \\ncars have hydraulic brakes. Santro cars have gas brakes. So, we cannot write a \\nparticular braking mechanism in this method.

There is no scope for catering the individual requirements of objects. Abstract \\nclasses are more flexible and useful than ordinary classes since they cater the common \\nneeds of the objects as well as their individual needs also.  \\nInterfaces in Python \\nWe learned that an abstract class is a class which contains some abstract methods as \\nwell as concrete methods also. Imagine there is a class that contains only abstract \\nmethods and there are no concrete methods. It becomes an interface. This means an \\ninterface is an abstract class but it contains only abstract methods. None of the methods \\nin the interface will have body. Only method headers will be written in the interface. So \\nan interface can be defined as a specification of method headers. Since, we write only \\nabstract methods in the interface, there is possibility for providing different \\nimplementations (body) for those abstract methods depending on the requirements of \\nobjects. In the languages like Java, an interface is created using the key word ‘interface’ \\nbut in Python an interface is created as an abstract class only. The interface concept is \\nnot explicitly available in Python. We have to use abstract classes as interfaces in Python.  \\nSince an interface contains methods without body, it is not possible to create objects to \\nan interface. In this case, we can create sub classes where we can implement all the \\nmethods of the interface. Since the sub classes will have all the methods with body, it is \\npossible to create objects to the sub classes. The flexibility lies in the fact that every sub \\nclass can provide its own implementation for the abstract methods of the interface.  \\nSince, none of the methods have body in the interface, we may tend to think that writing \\nan interface is mere waste. This is not correct. In fact, an interface is more useful when \\ncompared to the class owing to its flexibility of providing necessary implementation \\nneeded by the objects. Let’s elucidate this point further with an example. We have some \\nrupees in our hands. We can spend in rupees only by going to a shop where billing is \\ndone in rupees. Suppose we have gone to a shop where only dollars are accepted, we \\ncannot use our rupees there. This money is like a ‘class’. A class satisfies the only \\nrequirement intended for it. It is not useful to handle a different situation. \\nSuppose we have an international credit card. Now, we can pay by using our credit card \\nin rupees in a shop. If we go to another shop where they expect us to pay in dollars, we \\ncan pay in dollars. The same credit card can be used to pay in pounds also. Here, the \\ncredit card is like an interface which performs several tasks. In fact, the credit card is a'),\n",

It contains just our name, our bank \\nname and perhaps some number. But how the shop keepers are able to draw the money \\nfrom the credit card? Behind the credit card, we got our bank account which holds the \\nmoney from where it is transferred to the shop keepers. This bank account can be taken \\nas a sub class which actually performs the task. See Figure 15.3: \\nFigure 15.3: Interface and Sub Classes  \\nLet’s see how the interface concept is advantageous in software development. A \\nprogrammer is asked to write a Python program to connect to a database and retrieve the \\ndata, process the data and display the results in the form of some reports. For this \\npurpose, the programmer has written a class to connect to Oracle database, something \\nlike this: \\n# this class works with Oracle database only \\nclass Oracle: \\n    def connect(self): \\n        print('Connecting to Oracle database...') \\n \\n    def disconnect(self): \\n        print('Disconnected from Oracle.') \\nThis class has a limitation. It can connect only to Oracle database. If a client (user) using \\nany other database (for example, Sybase database) uses this code to connect to his \\ndatabase, this code will not work. So, the programmer is asked to design his code in such \\na way that it is used to connect to any database in the world. How is it possible? \\nOne way is to write several classes, each to connect to a particular database. Thus, \\nconsidering all the databases available in the world, the programmer has to write a lot of \\nclasses. This takes a lot of time and effort. Even though the programmer spends a lot of \\ntime and writes all the classes, by the time the software is released into the market, all \\nthe versions of the databases will change and the programmer is supposed to rewrite the \\nclasses again to suit the latest versions of databases. This is very cumbersome.\"),\n",

The programmer writes an interface ‘Myclass’ with \\nabstract methods as shown here: \\n# an interface to connect to any database \\nclass Myclass(ABC): \\n    @abstractmethod \\n    def connect(self): \\n        pass \\n    @abstractmethod \\n    def disconnect(self): \\n        pass \\nWe cannot create objects to the interface. So, we need sub classes where all these \\nmethods of the interface are implemented to connect to various databases . This task is \\nleft for other companies that are called third party vendors. The third party vendors will \\nprovide sub classes to Myclass interface. For example, Oracle Corp people may provide a \\nsub class where the code related to connecting to the Oracle database and disconnecting \\nfrom the database will be provided as: \\n# this is a sub class to connect to Oracle \\nclass Oracle(Myclass): \\n    def connect(self): \\n        print('Connecting to Oracle database...') \\n \\n    def disconnect(self): \\n        print('Disconnected from Oracle.') \\nNote that ‘Oracle’ is a sub class of Myclass interface. Similarly, the Sybase company \\npeople may provide another implementation class ‘Sybase’, where code related to \\nconnecting to Sybase database and disconnecting from Sybase will be provided as: \\n# this is another sub class to connect to Sybase \\nclass Sybase(Myclass): \\n    def connect(self): \\n        print('Connecting to Sybase database...') \\n \\n    def disconnect(self): \\n        print('Disconnected from Sybase.') \\nNow, it is possible to create objects to the sub classes and call the connect() method and \\ndisconnect() methods from a main program. This main program is also written by the \\nsame programmer who develops the interface. Let’s understand that the programmer who \\ndevelops the interface does not know the names of the sub classes as they will be \\ndeveloped in future by the other companies. In the main program, the programmer is \\nsupposed to create objects to the sub classes without knowing their names. This is done \\nusing globals() function.  \\nFirst, the programmer should accept the database name from the user. It may be ‘Oracle’ \\nor ‘Sybase’. This name should be taken in a string, say ‘str’. The next step  is to convert \\nthis string into a class name using the built-in function globals(). The globals() function \\nreturns a dictionary containing current global names and globals()[str] returns the name \\nof the class that is in 'str'. Hence, we can get the class name as: \\nclassname = globals()[str]\"),\n",

It provides abstract classes which \\ncan be used as either abstract classes or interfaces. It is the discretion of the programmer \\nto decide when to use an abstract class and when to go for an interface. Generally, \\nabstract class is written when there are some common features shared by all the objects \\nas they are. For example, take a class WholeSaler which represents a whole sale shop \\nwith text books and stationery like pens, papers and note books as:  \\n# an abstract class \\nclass WholeSaler(ABC): \\n    @abstractmethod \\n    def text_books(self): \\n        pass \\n    @abstractmethod \\n    def stationery(self): \\n        pass \\nLet’s take Retailer1, a class which represents a retail shop. Retailer1 wants text books of \\nX class and some pens. Similarly, Retailer2 also wants text books of X class and some \\npapers. In this case, we can understand that the text_books() is the common feature \\nshared by both the retailers. But the stationery asked by the retailers is different. This \\nmeans, the stationery has different implementations for different retailers but there is a \\ncommon feature, i.e., the text books. So in this case, the programmer designs the \\nWholeSaler class as an abstract class. Retailer1 and Retailer2 are sub classes.\"),\n",

Suppose, Retailer1 asks for VII class text \\nbooks and Retailer2 asks for X class text books, then even the text_books() method of \\nWholeSaler class needs different implementations depending on the retailer. It means, \\nthe text_books() method and also stationery() methods should be implemented differently \\ndepending on the retailer. So, in this case, the programmer designs the WholeSaler as an \\ninterface and Retailer1 and Retailer2 become sub classes. \\nThere is a responsibility for the programmer to provide the sub classes whenever he \\nwrites an abstract class. This means the same development team should provide the sub \\nclasses for the abstract class. But if an interface is written, any third party vendor will \\ntake the responsibility of providing sub classes. This means, the programmer prefers to \\nwrite an interface when he wants to leave the implementation part to the third party \\nvendors.  \\nIn case of an interface, every time a method is called, PVM should search for the method \\nin the implementation classes which are installed elsewhere in the system and then \\nexecute the method. This takes more time. But when an abstract class is written, since \\nthe common methods are defined within the abstract class and the sub classes are \\ngenerally in the same place along with the software, PVM will not have that much \\noverhead to execute a method. Hence, interfaces are slow when compared to abstract \\nclasses. \\nPoints to Remember \\n\\uf071 An abstract method is a method whose action is redefined in the sub classes as per \\nthe requirement of the objects.  \\n\\uf071 Generally, an abstract method is written without any body. But it is possible to write \\nan abstract method with body also.  \\n\\uf071 A method with body is called concrete method.  \\n\\uf071 An abstract class is a class that contains some abstract methods. An abstract class \\ncan also contain concrete methods.  \\n\\uf071 Abstract methods are written with a decorator @abstractmethod above them.  \\n\\uf071 It is not possible to create an object (or instance) to an abstract class. \\n\\uf071 Every abstract class should derive from ABC class that is available in abc (abstract \\nbase class) module. \\n\\uf071 All the abstract methods of the abstract class should be rewritten with body in the \\nsub classes.

Designing such programs is needed in any software development. For this \\npurpose, the programmer should handle the errors. When the errors can be handled, \\nthey are called exceptions.   \\nTo handle exceptions, the programmer should perform the following three steps: \\nStep 1: The programmer should observe the statements in his program where there may \\nbe a possibility of exceptions. Such statements should be written inside a ‘try’ block. A \\ntry block looks like as follows: \\ntry: \\n    statements \\nThe greatness of try block is that even if some exception arises inside it, the program will \\nnot be terminated. When PVM understands that there is an exception, it jumps into an \\n‘except’ block. \\nStep 2:  The programmer should write the ‘except’ block where he should display the \\nexception details to the user. This helps the user to understand that there is some error \\nin the program. The programmer should also display a message regarding what can be \\ndone to avoid this error. Except block looks like as follows: \\nexcept exceptionname: \\n    statements   # these statements form handler \\nThe statements written inside an except block are called ‘handlers’ since they handle the \\nsituation when the exception occurs.  \\nStep 3: Lastly, the programmer should perform clean up actions like closing the files and \\nterminating any other processes which are running. The programmer should write this \\ncode in the finally block. Finally block looks like as follows: \\nfinally: \\n    statements \\nThe specialty of finally block is that the statements inside the finally block are executed \\nirrespective of whether there is an exception or not. This ensures that all the opened files \\nare properly closed and all the running processes are properly terminated. So, the data in \\nthe files will not be corrupted and the user is at the safe-side. \\nPerforming the above 3 tasks is called ‘exception handling’. Remember, in exception \\nhandling, the programmer is not preventing the exception, as in many cases it is not \\npossible. But the programmer is avoiding any damage that may happen to data and \\nsoftware. Let’s rewrite program 6 to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception using try, \\nexcept and finally blocks.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 7: A Python program to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception. \\n# an exception handling example \\ntry: \\n    f = open(\"myfile\", \"w\") \\n    a, b = [int(x) for x in input(\"Enter two numbers: \").split()]'),\n",

If the balance amount is below Rs. \\n2000.00, then the programmer wants to raise an exception saying ‘ Balance amount is \\nless in the account of so and so person’. This will be helpful to the bank authorities to \\nfind out the customer.  \\nSo, the programmer wants an exception that is raised when the balance amount in an \\naccount is less than Rs 2000.00. Since there is no such exception available in Python, \\nthe programmer has to create his own exception. For this purpose, he has to follow these \\nsteps: \\n1. Since all exceptions are classes, the programmer is supposed to create his own \\nexception as a class. Also, he should make his class as a sub class to the in-built \\n‘Exception’ class.  \\nclass MyException(Exception): \\n    def __init__(self, arg): \\n        self.msg = arg \\n Here, ‘MyException’ class is the sub class for ‘Exception’ class. This class has a \\nconstructor where a variable ‘msg’ is defined. This ‘msg’ receives a message passed \\nfrom outside through ‘arg’.  \\n2. The programmer can write his code; maybe it represents a group of statements or a \\nfunction. When the programmer suspects the possibility of exception, he should raise \\nhis own exception using ‘raise’ statement as: \\nraise MyException(‘message') \\n Here, raise statement is raising MyException class object that contains the given \\n‘message’.  \\n3. The programmer can insert the code inside a ‘try’ block and catch the exception using \\n‘except’ block as: \\ntry: \\n    code \\nexcept MyException as me: \\n    print(me) \\nHere, the object ‘me’ contains the message given in the raise statemen t. All these steps \\nare shown in Program 14. In this program, we are passing a dictionary with names and \\nbalances to the check() function. As dictionary elements, name is the key and balance is \\nthe value. The check() function displays these details and checks whether the balance is \\nless than 2000.00. If it is so, then it raises MyException with a message: 'Balance \\namount is less in the account of so and so person’. This message is passed to ‘except’ \\nblock where it is displayed.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 14: A Python program to create our own exception and raise it when needed.  \\n# create our own class as sub class to Exception class \\nclass MyException(Exception): \\n    def __init__(self, arg): \\n        self.msg = arg\"),\n",

The file \\nwhich stores the m essages, especially of errors or exceptions is called a ‘log’ file and this \\ntechnique is called ‘logging’. When we store the messages into a log file, we can open the \\nfile and read it or take a print out of the file later. This helps the programmers to \\nunderstand how many errors are there, the names of those errors and where they are \\noccurring in the program.  This information will enable them to pin point the errors and \\nalso rectify them easily. So, logging helps in debugging the programs.  \\nPython provides a module ‘logging’ that is useful to create a log file that can store all error \\nmessages that may occur while executing a program.  \\nThere may be different levels of error messages. For example, an error that crashes the \\nsystem should be given more importance than an error that merely displays a warning \\nmessage.  So, depending on the seriousness of the error, they are classified into 6 levels \\nin ‘logging’ module, as shown in Table 16.2: \\nTable 16.2: Logging Error Level and their Predefined Numeric Values \\nLevel Numeric value Description \\nCRITICAL 50 Represents a very serious error that needs high \\nattention. \\nERROR 40 Represents a serious error.  \\nWARNING 30 Represents a warning message, some caution is\"),\n",

Only the messages which are equal to or above the \\nlevel of a WARNING are displayed. That means WARNINGS, ERRORS and CRITICAL \\nERRORS are displayed. It is possible that we can set this default behavior as we need.  \\nTo understand different levels of logging messages, we are going to write a Python \\nprogram. In this program, first we have to create a file for logging (storing) the messages. \\nThis is done using basicConfig() method of logging module as: \\nlogging.basicConfig(filename=’mylog.txt’, level=logging.ERROR) \\nHere, the log file name is given as ‘mylog.txt’. The level is set to ERROR. Hence the \\nmessages whose level will be at ERROR or above, (i.e. ERROR or CRITICAL) will only be \\nstored into the log file. Once, this is done, we can add the messages to the ‘mylog.txt’  \\nfile as: \\nlogging.methodname(‘message’) \\nThe methodnames can be critical(), error(), warning(), info() and debug(). For example, we \\nwant to add a critical message, we should use critical() method as:  \\nlogging.critical(‘System crash - Immediate attention required’) \\nNow, this error message is stored into the log file, i.e. ‘mylog.txt’.

This means that even \\nthough the computer is switched off, the data is  not removed from the memory since \\nthe file is stored on hard disk or CD. This file data can be utilized later, whenever \\nrequired.  \\n\\uf071 It is possible to update the file data. For example, we can add new data to the existing \\nfile, delete unnecessary data from the file and modify the available data of the file. \\nThis makes the file more useful. \\n\\uf071 Once the data is stored in a file, the same data can be shared by various programs. \\nFor example, once employee data is stored in a file, it can be used in a program to \\ncalculate employees’ net salaries or in another program to calculate income tax \\npayable by the employees.  \\n\\uf071 Files are highly useful to store huge amount of data. For example, voters’ list or \\ncensus data.  \\nTypes of Files in Python \\nIn Python, there are two types of files. They are: \\n\\uf071 Text files \\n\\uf071 Binary files \\nText files store the data in the form of characters. For example, if we store employee \\nname “Ganesh”, it will be stored as 6 characters and the employee salary 8900.75 is \\nstored as 7 characters. Normally, text files are used to store characters or strings.  \\nBinary files store entire data in the form of bytes, i.e. a group of 8 bits each. For example, \\na character is stored as a byte and an integer is stored in the form of 8 bytes (on a 64 bit'),\n",

When the da ta is retrieved from the binary file, the programmer can retrieve \\nthe data as bytes. Binary files can be used to store text, images, audio and video.  \\nImage files are generally available in .jpg, .gif or .png formats. We cannot use text files to \\nstore images as the images do not contain characters. On the other hand, images contain \\npixels which are minute dots with which the picture is composed of. Each pixel can be \\nrepresented by a bit, i.e. either 1 or 0.

We can use any \\nname to reflect the actual data. For example, we can use ‘empdata’ as file name to \\nrepresent the employee data. The file ‘open mode’ represents the purpose of opening the \\nfile. Table 17.1 specifies the file open modes and their meanings: \\nTable 17.1: The File Opening Modes \\nFile open mode Description  \\nw To write data into file.

Apar t from these, we can use any positive \\ninteger for buffering. Suppose, we use 500, then a buffer of 500 bytes size is used via \\nwhich the data is read or written. If we do not mention any buffering integer, then the \\ndefault buffer size used is 4096 or 8192 bytes.  \\nWhen the open() function is used to open a file, it returns a pointer to the beginning of \\nthe file. This is called ‘file handler’ or ‘file object’. As an example, to open a file for storing \\ndata into it, we can written the open() function as:  \\nf = open(“myfile.txt”, “w”) \\nHere, ‘f’ represents the file handler or file object. It refers to the file with the name \\n“myfile.txt” that is opened in “w” mode. This means, we can write data into the file but we \\ncannot read data from this file. If this file exists already, then its contents are deleted and \\nthe present data is stored into the file.  \\nClosing a File \\nA file which is opened should be closed using the close() method. Once a file is opened \\nbut not closed, then the data of the file may be corrupted or deleted in some cases. Also, \\nif the file is not closed, the memory utili zed by the file is not freed , leading to problems \\nlike insufficient memory. This happens when we are working with several files \\nsimultaneously. Hence it is mandatory to close the file.  \\nf.close() \\nHere, the file represented by the file object ‘f’ is closed. It means ‘f’ is deleted from the \\nmemory. Once the file object is lost, the file data will become inaccessible. If we want to \\ndo any work with the file again, we should once again open the file using the open() \\nfunction.  \\nIn Program 1, we are creating a file where we want to store some characters. We know \\nthat a group of characters represent a string. After entering a string from the keyboard \\nusing input() function, we store the string into the file using write() method as: \\nf.write(str)'),\n",

When we conduct \\nreading or writing op erations on a binary file, a file pointer moves inside the file \\ndepending on how many bytes are written or read from the file. For example, if we read \\n10 bytes of data from a file, the file pointer will be positioned at the 10 th byte so that it is \\npossible to continue reading from the 11 th byte onwards. To know the position of the file \\npointer, we can use the tell() method. It returns the current position of the file pointer \\nfrom the beginning of the file. It is used in the form: \\nn = f.tell() \\nHere, ‘f’ represents file handler or file object. ‘n’ is an integer that represents the byte \\nposition where the file pointer is positioned.  \\nIn case, we want to move the file pointer to another position, we can use the seek() \\nmethod. This method takes two arguments: \\nf.seek(offset, fromwhere) \\nHere, ‘offset’ represents how many bytes to move. ‘fromwhere’ represents from which \\nposition to move. For example, ‘fromwhere’ can be 0, 1 or 2. Here, 0 represents from the \\nbeginning of the file, 1 represents from the current positio n and 2 represents from the \\nending of the file. The default value of ‘fromwhere’ is 0, i.e. beginning of the file.  \\nf.seek(10)   # same as f.seek(10, 0) \\nThis will move the file pointer to the 11 th byte (i.e. 10+1) from the beginning of the file (0 \\nrepresents beginning of the file). So, any reading operation will read data from 11 th byte \\nonwards.  \\nf.seek(-10, 2) \\nThis will move the file pointer to the 9 th byte ( -10+1) from the ending of the file (2 \\nrepresents ending of the file). The negative sign before 10 represents moving back in the \\nfile.  \\nWe will take an example to understand how these methods work in case of a binary file. \\nObserve the following code snippet where we open a binary file ‘line.txt’ in ‘r+b’ mode so \\nthat it is possible to write data into the file and read data from the file.  \\nwith open('line.txt', 'r+b') as f: \\n    f.write(b'Amazing Python')\"),\n",

The write() method is storing a string 'Amazing Python' into the file. \\nObserve ‘b’ prefixed with this string to consider it as a binary string. Now, the string is \\nstored in the file as shown in the Figure 17.3:  \\n \\nFigure 17.3: The string’s characters and their byte positions in the file.  \\nFirst, we will move the file pointer to the 4th byte using seek() as: \\nf.seek(3) \\nThe preceding method will put the file pointer at 3+1 = 4th position. So, file pointer will be \\nat ‘z’. If we print 2 bytes using read() method as: \\nprint(f.read(2)) \\nThis will display ‘zi’. Now, to know the position of the file pointer we can use tell() method \\nas: \\nprint(f.tell()) \\nThis will display 5. Now, to move the file pointer to 5th position from the ending of the file, \\nwe can use seek() method as: \\nf.seek(-6, 2) \\nThis will move the file pointer to -6+1 = 5th position. It means it will be positioned at the \\ncharacter ‘y’. We can display this character using read() method as: \\nprint(f.read(1)) \\nThis will display ‘y’. Now, we can find the position of the file pointer using the tell() \\nmethod as: \\nprint(f.tell()) \\nThis will display 10 as the character ‘y’ is at 10th position from the beginning of the file. \\nPlease remember the tell() method always gives the positions from the beginning of the \\nfile.  \\nRandom Accessing of Binary Files \\nData in the binary files is stored in  the form of continuous bytes. Let’s take a binary file \\nhaving 1000 bytes of data. If we want to access the last 10 bytes of data, it is not needed \\nto search the file byte by byte from the beginning. It is possible to directly go to 991st byte \\nusing the seek() method as: \\nf.seek(900) \\nThen read the last 10 bytes using the read() method as: \\nf.read(10)\"),\n",

This is \\npossible by moving the file pointer to any location in the file and then performing reading \\nor writing operations on the file as required.  \\nA problem with binary files is that they accept data in the form of bytes or in binary \\nformat. For example , if we store a string into a binary file, as shown in the following \\nstatement, we will end up with an error. \\nstr = 'Dear' \\nwith open('data.bin', 'wb') as f: \\n    f.write(str)   # store str \\n    f.write('Hello')   # store ‘Hello’ \\nThe preceding code will display the following error: \\nTypeError: ‘str’ does not support the buffer interface.  \\nThe reas on behind this error is that we are trying to store strings into a binary file \\nwithout converting them into binary format. So, the solution is to convert the ordi nary \\nstrings into binary format before they are stored into the binary file. Now consider the \\nfollowing code:  \\nstr = 'Dear' \\nwith open('data.bin', 'wb') as f: \\n    f.write(str.encode()) \\n    f.write(b'Hello') \\nConverting a string literal into binary format can  be done by prefixing the character ‘b’ \\nbefore the string, as: b'Hello'. On the other hand, to convert a string variable into binary \\nformat, we have to use encode() method, as: str.encode(). \\nThe encode() method represents the string in byte format so that it can be stored into the \\nbinary file. Similarly, when we read a string from a binary file, it is advisable to convert it \\ninto ordinary text format using decode() method, as: str.decode().  \\nIn the following program, we are creating a binary file and storing a group of strings. One \\nway to view the data of a binary file is as a group of records with fixed length. For \\nexample, we want to take 20 bytes (or characters) as one record and store several such \\nrecords into the file. Program 14 demonstrates how to store names of cities as a group of \\nrecords into cities.bin file. In this program, each record length is taken as 20. So, if the \\ncity name entered by the user is less than 20 characters length, then the remaining \\ncharacters in the record will be filled with spaces. For example, if the user stores the city \\nname ‘Delhi’, since ‘Delhi’ has only 5 characters, another 15 spaces will be attached at \\nthe end of this name and then it is stored into the file. In this way, each record is \\nmaintained with fixed length. Consider the following code: \\nln = len(city)   # find length of city name. suppose it is 5 \\ncity = city + (20-ln)*' '   # add 15 spaces at the end of city name\"),\n",

It means, once a \\nbinary file is created with some data, that data is viewed as strings and can be \\nmanipulated using mmap module. The first step to use the mmap module is to map the \\nfile using the mmap() method as: \\nmm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0) \\nThis will map the currently opened file (i.e. ‘f’) with the file object ‘mm’. Please observe the \\narguments of mmap() method. The first argument is ‘f.fileno()’ .This indicates that fileno() \\nis a handle to the file object ‘f’. This ‘f’ represents the actual binary file that is being \\nmapped. The second argument is zero( 0 ) represents the total size of the file should  be \\nconsidered for mapping.  So, the entire file represented by the file object ‘f’ is mapped in \\nmemory to the object ‘mm’.

Then the algorithm searches for the next bit pattern \\nwhich is most often repeated in the input file. In its place, a 1 is substituted. The third \\nrepeated bit pattern will be replaced by 10, the fourth by 11, the fifth by 100, and so on. \\nIn this way, the original bit patterns are replaced by lesser number of bits. This file with \\nlesser number of bits is called ‘zipped file’ or ‘compressed file’.  \\nTo g et back the original data from the zipped file, we can follow a reverse algorithm, \\nwhich substitutes the original bit pattern wherever particular bits are found.

Let’s understand why this is so.  \\nWhen we write a normal string as: \\nstr = 'This is normal\\\\nstring' \\nNow, print(str) will display the preceding string in two lines as: \\nThis is normal \\nstring \\nThus the ‘\\\\n’ character is interpreted as new line in the normal string by the Python \\ninterpreter and hence the string is broken there and shown in the new line.  In regular \\nexpressions when ‘\\\\n’ is used, it does not mean to throw the string into new line. There \\n‘\\\\n’ has a different mean ing and it should not be interpreted as new line. For this \\npurpose, we should take this as a ‘raw’ string. This is done by prefixing ‘r’ before the \\nstring. \\nstr = r'This is raw\\\\nstring' \\nWhen we display this string using print(str), the output will be: \\nThis is raw\\\\nstring \\nSo, the normal meaning of ‘\\\\n’ is escaped and it is no more an escape character in the \\npreceding example. Since ‘\\\\n’ is not an escape character, it is interpreted as a character \\nwith different meaning in the regular expression by the Python interpreter. Similarly, the \\ncharacters like ‘\\\\t’, ‘\\\\w’, ‘\\\\c’, etc. should be interpreted as special characters in the \\nregular expressions and hence the expressions should be written as raw strings. If we do \\nnot want to write the regular expressions as raw strings, then the alternative is to use \\nanother backslash before such characters. For example, we can write: \\nreg = r'm\\\\w\\\\w'   # as raw string \\nreg = 'm\\\\\\\\w\\\\\\\\w'   # as normal string \\nBut using backslashes like this may be confusing for the programmer. Now, let’s go back \\nto our first regular expression:  \\nreg = r'm\\\\w\\\\w' \\nThis expression is written in single quotes to represent that it is a string. The first \\ncharacter ‘m’ represents that the words starting with ‘m’ should be matched. The next \\ncharacter ‘\\\\w’ represents any one character in A to Z, a to z and 0 to 9. Since we used \\ntwo ‘\\\\w’ characters, they represent any two characters after ‘m’. So, this regular \\nexpression represents words or strings having three characters and with ‘m’ as first \\ncharacter. The next two characters can be any alphanumeric.  \\nYes, we developed our first regular expression! The next step is to compile this expression \\nusing compile() method of ‘re’ module as: \\nprog = re.compile(r'm\\\\w\\\\w')\"),\n",

For example, to store two \\nvalues like 10 and ‘Raj’, we can take two variables and store these values into \\nthose variables. But this task will be difficult when there are several values. For \\nexample, let’s take a small company having more than 100 employees whose details \\nshould be stored in memory and processed. In such cases, Python provides data \\nstructures like arrays, lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries. These data structures store \\nelements in various models. Basically, a data structure represents arrangement of \\nelements in memory in a particular model. Data structures are also known as abstract \\ndata types (ADTs).  \\nArrays and lists are similar. They can store a lot of elements (or values). There is no fixed \\nsize for arrays or lists. They can grow dynamically depending on the number of elements. \\nThe main difference between arrays and lists is that arrays can store only one type of \\nelement; whereas, lists can store different types of elements.    \\nIn the languages like C, C++ and Java, we talk about data structures where a structure \\n(or container) is used to store a group of elements. The structure provides methods to \\nhandle the elements. For example, linked list, stack and queues are examples for \\nfundamental data structures. In this chapter, we will have an idea regarding how these \\ndata structures can be created and used.  \\nLists are versatile data structures in Python since they can store any type of elements \\nand it is possible to store different types of el ements also. Internally, lists are \\nimplemented as arrays in Python. A list is created as an array having references to \\nelements or objects. The problem in using arrays as lists is that all the operations may \\nnot be done in the same amount of time. Inserting and deleting elements at the end of the \\nlist would be faster than doing the same operations in the beginning or middle, since the \\nentire list (i.e. array) elements need to shift towards right. However, except this minor \\ninconvenience, lists can be used in our programs to create linked lists, stacks or queues.  \\nDATA \\nSTRUCTURES IN \\nPYTHON \\nChapter\\n \\n19 \\nH'),\n",

For example employees’ data like \\nemployee id number, name, address, department name, etc. should be stored permanently \\nin a file so that it can be  retrieved and utilized at any time. Sometimes, logic will be more \\nimportant than data. We may want to store data in memory and apply some logic to get the \\nresults instantly. Here, we should use data structures. For example, let’s take customers \\nqueue at the billing counter in a shopping mall. In this case, the information of the items \\npurchased by the customers should be entered into computer and calculate the total bill \\namount immediately. In such cases, we need to use queue data structure since the \\ncustomers should be cleared in ‘first in first out’ basis from the queue.   \\nNow, we proceed further to discuss how to implement various fundamental data \\nstructures with the help of lists in Python.  \\nLinked Lists \\nA linked list contains a group of elements in the form of nodes. Each node will have three \\nfields: \\n1. The data field that contains data. \\n2. A link field that contains reference to the previous node. \\n3. Another link field that contains reference to the next node. \\nLink fields store references, i.e.,  memory locations. These link fields are useful to move \\nfrom one node to another node in the linked list so that any operation can be done in a \\nminimum amount of time. See Figure 19.1.  \\nLinked list is very convenient to store data. The operations like inserting e lements, \\nremoving elements, searching for an element etc. are done very quickly and almost in the \\nsame amount of time. Linked list is one of the fastest data structure. Hence, linked list is \\nused where time critical operations are to be performed.  \\n \\nFigure 19.1:  Node Structure and a Linked List with Nodes \\nPython provides list data type that can be used to implement linked lists. The following \\nare the operations that are generally performed on linked lists: \\n\\uf071 Traversing the linked list: This means visiting every node and displaying the data of \\nthe node. Thus all the elements of the node should be displayed. This can be done \\nusing a for loop on the list elements as:'),\n",

This can be done using insert() method of the list in the \\nfollowing format:  \\ninsert(position, element) \\n\\uf071 Removing elements from the linked list: This is done using remove() method of the \\nlist as remove(element).

This \\nmeans that the element which is stored as a last element into the stack will be the first \\nelement to be removed from the stack. Inserting elements (objects) into stack is called \\n'push operation' and removing elements from  stack is called 'pop operation'. Searching \\nfor an element and returning it without removing it from the stack is called ‘peep \\noperation’. Insertion and deletion of elements take place only from one side of the stack, \\ncalled ‘top’ of the stack, as shown in Figure 19.2. The other side of the stack is called \\n‘bottom’ of the stack which is closed and thus does not allow any operations.  \\n \\nFigure 19.2:  A Stack with some Elements \\nStacks must strictly follow LIFO order where the last element pushed on to the top of the \\nstack should be popped first. Let’s take a hotel where a pile of plates are made available \\nto the customers in a counter. These plates are accessible in such a way that the last \\nwashed plate will be available to the first customer. If the customer takes the top plate \\n(the 3rd plate) from the pile, the weight on the spring will be lessened and the next plate \\n(2nd one) will come up. See Figure 19.3(a). If the elements are stored in memory in this \\nmodel, then it is called a stack.  \\nSimilarly, a Compact Disk holder where the CDs are arranged such that the last CD is \\navailable first is also an example of a stack. See Figure 19.3(b). If the elements are \\narranged in memory as CDs are in the holder, it is called a stack.\"),\n",

It means that when the program is running, the state of the variables and \\ninformation about the execution status are stored in a stack. Another use of stack is i n \\nexpression evaluation. While evaluating expressions like ax +by * 5, they are converted \\ninto postfix or prefix notations using a stack and stored into the stack. Later, they are \\nretrieved from the stack and evaluated according to certain rules.  \\nPython provides list data types that can be used to create stacks. We should first create a \\nStack class with the following general operations: \\n\\uf071 Push operation: It means inserting element at the top of the stack. This can be done \\nwith the help of append() method of the list as: st.append(element) where ‘st’ is a list.  \\n\\uf071 Pop operation: It means removing the topmost element from the stack. This can be \\nperformed using pop() method of the list as: st.pop(). This method returns the \\nremoved element that can be displayed. \\n\\uf071 Peep operation: It means returning the topmost element without deleting it from the \\nstack. Peep is also known as ‘peek’ operation. This is done by returning st[n -1] \\nelement where ‘n’ is the number of elements (or size) of the stack. So, if the stack has \\n5 el ements, the topmost element position will be 4 since the elements are referred \\nfrom 0th to 4th positions.   \\n\\uf071 Searching operation: It means knowing the position of an element in the stack from \\nthe top of the stack. For this purpose, the list’s index() method  can be used as: \\nst.index(element) which returns the position number ‘n’ of the element from the \\nbeginning (or bottom) of the stack. Once this is known, we can get its position from \\nthe top of the stack as: size of the stack – n.  \\n\\uf071 Empty stack or not: This can be judged by simply testing whether the list ‘st’ is \\nempty or not. We can use an expression as: ‘return st == []’ that returns True if ‘st’ is \\nempty else False.  \\nNow, let’s develop Stack class with methods to perform previously mentioned operations.'),\n",

Similarly, we can \\nremove the elements from the front and from the rear side (end) also. So, deques are \\nmore flexible and can be imagined as generalized form of queues and stacks that we \\ndiscussed in the previous sections. For example, if we insert the delete the elements only \\nfrom one end of the deque, then it becomes a stack. If we insert the elements from one \\nend and delete the elements from the other end, then it becomes a queue.   \\nIn Python, a class by the name ‘deque’ is provided in ‘collections’ module to work with \\ndeques. Python people used arrays internally in implementing lists which form the basis \\nfor creating queues. But in case of deques, they used doubly linked lists to implement the \\ndeques. Hence, deques are faster than the normal queues. To create a deque, we should \\nsimply create an object to deque class as: \\nd = deque() \\nIn this case, the deque can accommodate arbitrary number of elements. We can restrict \\nthe size of the deque by specifying ‘maxlen’ attribute as: \\nd = deque(maxlen= 100) \\nIn the preceding statemnet, we are creating a deque which can accommodate a maximum \\nof 100 elements only. The following are the operations provided in deque class in Python:  \\n\\uf071 Adding element at the front:  Assuming that the front will be at the left side of the \\ndeque, we can add an element at the front using appendleft() method, as: \\nappendleft(element).  \\n\\uf071 Deleting element at the front: This can be done using popleft() method, as: element \\n= popleft(). This method returns a copy of the element that is deleted. \\n\\uf071 Adding element at the rear: This can be done using append() method that adds the \\nelement at the right side of the deque, i.e. at the rear. The way we can use the \\nappend() method is: append(element). \\n\\uf071 Deleting element at the rear: This can be achieved by calling pop()  method on the \\ndeque. This method when called without any argument will remove the element at the \\nrear of the deque.  \\n\\uf071 Deleting element at any place:  This can be done using remove() method. If we use \\nremove(element), it will remove the element from the rear  part of the deque. This \\nmethod raises ValueError if the element being removed is not found.'),\n",

This means we are \\nwasting a lot of processor time and the microprocessor has to sit idle without any job for \\na long time. This is the drawback in single tasking.  But, in some cases where the tasks \\nshould be executed one by one without any time gap, single tasking would be preferable. \\nFor example, printing the marks sheets of students on the printer. \\nMultitasking \\nTo use the processor’s time in an optimum way, we can give it several jobs at a time. This \\nis called multitasking. But how can we give several jobs at a time?  Suppose there are 4 \\ntasks that we want to execute. We load them into the memory, as shown in Fig ure 21.2. \\nThe memory is divided into 4 parts and the jobs are loaded there. Now, the \\nmicroprocessor has to execute them all at a time. So the processor will take small time \\nduration, like a millisecond and divide this time between the number of jobs. Here, there \\nare 4 jobs. So we get ¼ millisecond time for each job. This small part of the processor \\ntime is called ‘time slice’. It will allot exactly ¼ millisecond time for executing each of the \\njobs. Within this time slice, it will try to execute each job. Suppose, the processor started \\nat first job, it will spend exactly ¼ millisecond time executing the first job . Within this \\ntime duration, if it could not complete the first job, then what it does? In that case, it \\nstores the intermediate results till then it obtained in a temporary memory, and then it \\ngoes to the second task. It then spends exactly ¼ millisecond time executing the second \\ntask. Within this time, if it can complete this task, no problem. Suppose it could not \\ncomplete this task, then it goes to the third task, storing the results in a temporary \\nmemory. Similarly, it will spend exactly ¼ millisecond f or the third task, and another ¼ \\nmillisecond for the fourth task. After executing the fourth task, it will come back to the \\nfirst task, in a circular manner. This is called ‘round robin’ method. In short, executing \\ntasks in a circular manner such that comi ng back to the first task after completing the \\nlast task is called as round robin method.'),\n",

It will execute the first task exactly for ¼ millisecond \\nthis time, and proceeds to the second task and then third and fourth before coming back \\nto the first task in a round robin way. So if you have submitted the first job, you can \\nunderstand that the processor is executing your job for ¼ millisecond and then keeping \\nyou waiting for another ¾ millisecond, while it is going and execu ting the other tasks. \\nAfter ¾ millisecond, it is again coming back to your job and executing it for another ¼ \\nmillisecond time. But you will not be aware that you are kept waiting for ¾ millisecond \\ntime, as this time is very small. You will feel that the p rocessor is spending its time \\nexecuting your job only. Similarly, the second person who submitted the second job will \\nalso feel that only his job is being executed by the processor. The third and fourth \\npersons will also feel the same way. It is something like all the 4 jobs are executed by the \\nprocessor simultaneously. This is called multitasking.  \\nGenerally, we have only one processor in our computer system. One processor has to \\nexecute several tasks means that it has to execute them in a round robin method. Strictly \\nspeaking, this is not multitasking. Since the processor is quickly executing the tasks one \\nby one, we feel all the jobs are executed by the processor at a time. Multitasking cannot \\nbe a real phenomenon with single processor systems. If we want  to really achieve \\nmultitasking, we need computers with multiple processors.  \\nThe main advantage of multitasking is to use the processor time in a better way.

We can imagine these threads as hands of the microprocessor . We have 2 \\nhands, so we can do 2 things at a time. Similarly, if a processor has 2 threads, it can do \\n2 tasks at a time. This is called thread-based multitasking. \\nDifferences between a Process and a Thread \\nA process represents a group of statements which are executed by the PVM using a main \\nthread. We can take a running program as an example for a process. Each process will \\nhave its own memory, a program counter that keeps track of the instruction being \\nexecuted and a stack that holds the data. The data of one process is generally isolated \\nfrom another process. It means the data or result of a process is generally not available to \\nanother process unless both the processes communicate explicitly.  \\nA thread also represents a group of statements within a program. When we want to use \\nthreads, we have to create them separately which are in turn run by the main thread. \\nThreads will not have their own memory and program counter. The data of one thread is \\nshared easily by another thread. So, it is possible that a thread can easily modify the \\ndata of another thread.  \\nAny program utilizes resources like memory and processor time. Hence it is called heavy \\nweight process. But a thread is a small part of the program that ta kes very less memory \\nand processor time. Hence threads are called light weight processes.'),\n",

In the same way, it is possible to create multiple threads and set them to \\nexecute different parts of the program simultaneously. Executing the tasks or parts of a \\nprogram simultaneously is called ‘concurrent programming’.  \\nWhen more than one thread is running at a time, the data of one thread is available to \\nanother thread. In such cases, there is a possibility that the data may undergo unwanted \\nmanipulations. This happens especially when more than one thread is acting on the data \\nsimultaneously. This will lead to wrong results. It means the PVM i s not thread safe. \\nHence, PVM uses an internal global interpreter lock (GIL) that allows only a single thread \\nto execute at any given moment. GIL does not allow more than one thread to run at a \\ntime. This becomes an obstacle to write concurrent programs in Python. Even when there \\nare many processors available in a computer system, the programmer can use the \\ncapability of only one processor at a time due to the restriction imposed by GIL. However, \\nGIL will not impose this restriction of using only one thread  at a time, in case of normal \\nPython programs that take some input and provide output. GIL will impose this \\nrestriction on  applications that involve  heavy amounts of CPU processing or those \\ninvolving multiple processors.  \\nUses of Threads \\nThreads are highly useful when we want to perform more than one task simultaneously. \\nThis is also known as ‘concurrent programming’. This makes the threads to be used in \\nthe following situations:  \\n\\uf071 Threads are mainly used in server -side programs to serve the needs of multipl e \\nclients on a network or Internet. On Internet, a server machine has to cater to the \\nneeds of thousands of clients at a time. For this purpose, if we use threads in the \\nserver, they can do various jobs at a time, thus they can handle several clients.  \\n\\uf071 Threads are also used to create games and animation. Animation means moving \\nobjects from one place to another. In many games, generally we have to perform more \\nthan one task simultaneously. There, threads will be of invaluable help. For example, \\nin a game, a flight may be moving from left to right.  A machine gun should shoot it, \\nreleasing the bullets at the flight. These two tasks should happen simultaneously. For \\nthis purpose, we can use 2 threads, one thread will move the flight and the other one \\nwill move the bullet, simultaneously towards the flight.'),\n",

So, we can \\ncreate a thread by creating  an object of Thread class and pass the function name as \\ntarget for the thread as: \\nt = Thread(target=functionname, [args=(arg1, arg2, …)]) \\nHere, we are creating the Thread class object ‘t’ that represents our thread. The ‘target’ \\nrepresents the function on  which the thread will act. ‘args’ represents a tuple of \\narguments which are passed to the function. Once the thread is created like this, it \\nshould be started by calling the start() method as: \\nt.start() \\nThen the thread ‘t’ will jump into the target function and executes the code inside that \\nfunction.

This can be done by writing the following statement: \\nclass MyThread(Thread): \\nHere, ‘MyThread’ represents the sub class of ‘Thread’ class. Now, any methods of Thread \\nclass are also available to our sub class. The ‘Thread’ class has the run() method which is \\nalso available to our sub class, i.e. to ‘MyThread’ class. The specialty of the run() method is \\nthat every thread will run this method when it is started. So, by overriding the run() \\nmethod, we can make the threads run our own run() method. Overriding a method – means \\nwriting our own method with the same name as the run() method of the super class.  \\nThe next step is to create the object of the ‘MyThread’ class which contains a copy of the \\nsuper class, i.e. the ‘Thread’ class.  \\nt1 = MyThread()\"),\n",

The threads ‘t1’ and ‘t2’ are running \\non the reserve() method of Railway class.  Since we have taken the available number of \\nberths as 1, when thread ‘t1’ enters the reserve() method, it sees available number of \\nberths as 1 and hence, it allots it to First Person and displays: \\n1 berths allotted for First Person \\nThen it will sleep for 1.5 seconds. In this time, the ticket will be printed on the printer. \\nWhen the first thread is sleeping, thread ‘t2’ also enters the reserve() method, and it also \\nsees that there is 1 berth remaining. The reason for this is that the available number of \\nberths is not yet updated by the first thread. So the second thread also sees 1 berth as \\navailable, and it allots the same berth to the Second Person. Then the thread ‘t2’ will also \\ngo into sleep state. Thread ‘t1’ wakes up first, and then it updates the available number \\nof berths as: \\nself.available-= wanted \\nNow available number of berths will become 0.

Since both the threads are \\nacting on the same object simultaneously, the result is unreliable.  \\nWhat is the solution for this problem?  You may think to update the number of berths \\nfirst and then let the thread go for sleep . So, you want to write the following sequence of \\nstatements: \\nself.available-= wanted \\nsleep(1.5) \\nIf you write in this way also, there is no guarantee that we will get correct output. It may \\ndisplay something like this: \\nAvailable no. of berths=1 \\n1 berths allotted for First Person \\nAvailable no. of berths=1 \\nSorry, no berths to allot \\nSo, we cannot rely on this program. The problem occurs here because 2 threads are \\nsimultaneously acting on the same method  (or same object). This problem can be solved \\nby allowing only one thread to access the reserve() method at any given moment of time. \\nSuppose thread ‘t1’ enters the method first, then any other thread should not be allowed \\nto act on the same method till ‘t1’ completes execution and comes out. This is called \\nthread synchronization or thread safe.'),\n",

The object on which the \\nthreads are sync hronized is called ‘synchronized object’ or ‘mutex’(mutually exclusive \\nlock).

When a thread enters \\nthe object, it locks the object and after the execution is completed, it will unlock the \\nobject and comes out of it. It is like a room with only one door. A person has entered the \\nroom and locked it from behind. The second person who wants to enter the room should \\nwait till the first person comes out. In this way, a thread also locks the object after \\nentering it. Then the next thread cann ot enter it till the first thread comes out. This \\nmeans the object is locked mutually on threads.  So, this locked object is called ‘mutex’ \\n(mutually exclusive lock).

For example, a \\nConsumer thread is waiting for a Producer to produce the data (or some goods). When \\nthe Producer thread completes production of data, then the Consumer thread should \\ntake that data and use it.  The Consumer thread does not know how much time it takes \\nfor the Producer to complete the production.  Let’s first plan the Producer class.At the \\nproducer side, we will take a list ‘lst’ to which the items will be added. The Producer \\nproduces 10 items and each time an item is produced, we can display a message ‘Item \\nproduced...’  \\nfor i in range(1, 11):# repeat from 1 to 10 \\n    lst.append(i)# add item to list  \\n    sleep(1)# every item may take some time \\n    print('Item produced...') \\nIn the Producer class, we take another boolean type variable ‘dataprodover’ and initialize \\nit to False. The idea is to make the ‘dataprodover’ variableTrue when the production of all \\nthe 10 items is completed.  \\ndataprodover=True \\nThis will inform the Consumer that the production is over and hence you can utilize the \\ndata available in the list ‘lst’. When the Producer is busy producing the data, n ow and \\nthen the Consumer will check if ‘dataprodover’ is True or not.  If ‘dataprodover’ is True, \\nthen Consumer takes the data from the list and uses it. If the ‘dataprodover’ shows False, \\nthen Consumer will sleep for some time (say 100 milliseconds) and then again checks the \\n‘dataprodover’ to know whether it is True or not. The way to implement this logic at \\nConsumer side is: \\n# sleep for 100 ms as long as dataprodover is False \\n# prod represents Producer instance that contains dataprodover \\nwhile prod.dataprodover==False: \\n    sleep(0.1) \\nIn this way, the Producer and Consumer can communicate with each other. But this is \\nnot an efficient way of communication. Why? Consumer checks the ‘dataprodover’ at \\nsome point of time, and finds it False. So it goe s into sleep for the next 100 milliseconds. \\nMeanwhile, the data production may be over. But Consumer comes out of sleep after 100 \\nmilliseconds and then only it can find ‘dataprodover’ is True. This means that there may\"),\n",

Consumer can wait using the wait() \\nmethod which terminates when Producer invokes notify() or notify_all() methods. The \\nwait() method is written in the form as follows: \\ncv.wait(timeout=0) \\nThis will wait till the notification is received.

The data can be taken from the queue and utilized by the \\nConsumer. A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) structure where the data is stored from \\none side and deleted from the other side. Queues are useful when several Producers want \\nto communicate with several Consumers. Another advantage is that while using queues, \\nwe need not use locks since queues are thread safe.  \\nTo create a Queue object, we can simply write: \\nq = Queue() \\nSuppose, we want to insert an item ‘i’ into the queue ‘q’, we can use the put() method, as: \\nq.put(i)'),\n",

The tkinter represents ‘toolkit \\ninterface’ for GUI. This is an interface for Python programmers that enable them to use \\nthe classes of TK module of TCL/TK language. Let’s see what this TCL/TK is. The TCL  \\n(Tool Command Language) is a powerful dynamic programming language, suitable for \\nweb and desktop applications, networking, administration, testing and many more. It is \\nopen source and hence can be used by any one freely. TCL language uses TK (Tool Kit) \\nlanguage to generate graphics. TK provides standard GUI not only for TCL but also for \\nmany other dynamic programming languages like Python. Hence, this TK is used by \\nPython programmers in developing GUI applications through Python’s tkinter module. \\nThe following are the general steps involved in basic GUI programs: \\n1. First of all, we should create the root window. The root window is the top level \\nwindow that provides rectangular space on the screen where we can display text, \\ncolors, images, components, etc. \\n2. In the root window, we have to allocate space for our use. This is done by creating a \\ncanvas or frame. So, canvas and frame are child windows in the root window. \\n3. Generally, we use canvas for displaying drawings like lines, arcs, circles, shapes, etc. \\nWe use frame for the purpose of displaying components like push buttons, check \\nbuttons, menus, etc. These components are also called ‘widgets’.  \\n4. When the user clicks on a widget like push button, we have to handle that event. It \\nmeans we have to respond to the events by performing the desired tasks. \\nNow, let’s proceed further with the top level window or root window and learn to create it.  \\nThe Root Window \\nTo display the graphical output, we need space on the screen. This space that is initially \\nallocated to every GUI program is called ‘top level window’ or ‘root window’. We can say \\nthat the root window is the highest level GUI component in any tkinter application. We \\ncan reach this root window by creating an object to Tk class. This is shown in Program 1. \\nThe root window will have a title bar that contains minimize, resize and close options. \\nWhen you click on close ‘X’ option, the window will be destroyed.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 1: A Python program to create root window or top level window. \\n# import all components from tkinter \\nfrom tkinter import *'),\n",

In short, a container is a space that displays the output to the user. There are \\ntwo important containers: \\n\\uf071 Canvas: This is a container that is generally used to draw shapes like lines, curves, \\narcs and circles.  \\n\\uf071 Frame: This is a container that is generally used to display widgets like buttons, \\ncheck buttons or menus.  \\nAfter creating the root window, we have to create space, i.e. the container in the root \\nwindow so that we can use this space for displaying any drawings or widgets.  \\nCanvas \\nA canvas is a rectangular area which can be used for drawing pictures like lines, circles, \\npolygons, arcs, etc. To create a canvas, we should create an object to Canvas class as: \\nc = Canvas(root, bg=\"blue\", height=500, width=600, cursor=\\'pencil\\') \\nHere, ‘c’ is the Canvas class object. ‘root’ is the name of the parent window. ‘bg’ \\nrepresents background color, ‘height’ and ‘width’ represent the height and width of the \\ncanvas in pixels. A pixel (picture element) is a minute dot with which all the text and \\npictures on the monitor are composed. When the monitor screen resolution is 1360 X \\n768, it indicates that the screen can accommodate 1360 pixels width-wise and 768 pixels \\nheight-wise. Consider Figure 22.4 to understand the pixels and screen coordinates in \\npixels. The top left corner of the screen will be at (0, 0) pixels as x and y coordinates. \\nWhen we move from left to right, the x coordinate increases and when we move from top \\nto bottom, the y coordinate increases. Thus the top right corner will be at (1360, 0). The \\nbottom left corner will be at (0, 768) and the bottom right corner will be at (1360, 768). \\nThe option ‘cursor’ represents the shape of the cursor in the canvas. Important cursor \\nshapes are: arrow, box_spiral, center_ptr, circle, clock, coffee_mug, cross, cross_reverse, \\ncrosshair, diamond_cross, dot, double_arrow, exchange, hand1, hand2, heart, left_ptr, \\nmouse, pencil, plus, question_arrow, right_ptr, star, tcross, top_side, umbrella, watch, \\nxterm, X_cursor.'),\n",

In the same way, \\n#000fff000 represents puregreenand#00ffffis cyan(greenplusblue). \\nOnce the canvas is created, it should be added to the root window. Then only it will be \\nvisible. This is done using the pack() method, as follows: \\nc.pack() \\nAfter the canvas is created, we can draw any shapes on the canvas. For example, to \\ncreate a line, we can use create_line() method, as: \\nid = c.create_line(50, 50, 200, 50, 200, 150, width=4, fill=\"white\") \\nThis creates a line with the connecting points (50, 50), (200, 50) and (200, 150). ‘width’ \\nspecifies the width of the line. The default width is 1 pixel. ‘fill’ specifies the color of the \\nline. The create_line() method returns an identification number. \\nTo create an oval, we can use the create_oval() method. An oval is also called ellipse.  \\nid = c.create_oval(100, 100, 400, 300, width=5, fill=\"yellow\",   \\n  outline=\"red\", activefill=\"green\") \\nThis creates an oval in the rectangular area defined by the top left coordinates (100,100) \\nand bottom lower coordinates (400, 300). If the rectangle has same width and height, \\nthen the oval will become a circle. ‘width’ represents the width of the oval in pixels. ‘fill’ \\nrepresents the color to fill and ‘outline’ represents the color to be used for the border. Th e \\noption ‘activefill’ represents the color to be filled when the mouse is placed on the oval.'),\n",

To \\ncreate a polygon, we can use the create_polygon() method as: \\nid = c.create_polygon(10, 10, 200, 200, 300, 200, width=3,   \\n  fill=\"green\", outline=\"red\", smooth=1, activefill=\"lightblue\") \\nHere, the polygon is created using the points (10, 10), (200, 200), (300, 200) and then the \\nlast point is again connected to the fir st point, i.e. (10, 10). The option ‘smooth’ can \\nbecome 0 or 1. If 0, it indicates a polygon with sharp edges and 1 indicates a polygon \\nwith smooth edges.  \\nSimilarly, to create a rectangle or square shaped box, we can use the create_rectangle() \\nmethod as:  \\nid = c.create_rectangle(500, 200, 700, 600, width=2, fill=\"gray\",  \\n  outline=\"black\", activefill=\"yellow\") \\nHere, the rectangle will be formed with the top left coordinate at (500, 200) pixels and the \\nlower bottom coordinate at (700, 600). The color of the rectangle will change from gray to \\nyellow when the mouse is placed on the rectangle.  \\nIt is also possible to display some text in the canvas. For this purpose, we should use the \\ncreate_text() method as: \\nid = c.create_text(500, 100, text=\"My canvas\", font= fnt,    \\n  fill=\"yellow\", activefill=\"green\") \\nHere, the ‘font’ option is showing ‘fnt’ object that can be created as: \\nfnt =(\\'Times\\', 40, \\'bold\\') \\nfnt =(\\'Times\\', -40, \\'bold italic underline\\') \\nThe first option ‘Times’ represents the font family name. This can  be ‘Times’, ‘Helvetica’, \\n‘Courier’, etc. The second option represents a number (40) that indicates the size of the \\nfont in points. If we want to mention the size of the font in pixels, we should use minus \\nsign before the size (-40). The third option indicates the style of the font. There are 3 \\nstyles: bold, italic and underline. We can mention any one or all the styles. If do not want \\nany style, we need not mention this option.  \\nWhatever we discussed so far can be shown in Program4.  \\n \\nProgram \\nProgram 4: A GUI program that demonstrates the creation of various shapes in canvas. \\nfrom tkinter import * \\n \\n# create root window \\nroot = Tk() \\n \\n# create Canvas as a child to root window \\nc = Canvas(root, bg=\"blue\", height=700, width=1200, cursor=\\'pencil\\') \\n \\n# create a line in the canvas \\nid = c.create_line(50, 50, 200, 50, 200, 150, width=4, fill=\"white\") \\n \\n# create an oval in the canvas'),\n",

Create the widgets that are needed in the program. A widget is a GUI component that \\nis represented as an object of a class. For example, a push button is a widget that is \\nrepresented as Button class object.  \\n As an example, suppose we want to create a push button, we can create an object to \\nButton class as: \\nb = Button(f, text='My Button') \\n Here, ‘f’ is Frame object to which the button is added. ‘My Button’ is the text that is \\ndisplayed on the button. \\n2. When the user interacts with a widget, he will generate an event. For example, \\nclicking on a push button is an event. Such events should be handled by writing \\nfunctions or routines. These functions are called in response to the events. Hence \\nthey are calle d ‘callback handlers’ or ‘event handlers’. Other examples for events are \\npressing the Enter button, right clicking the mouse button, etc.  \\n As an example, let’s write a function that may be called in response to button click. \\ndef buttonClick(self): \\n    print('You have clicked me') \\n3. When the user clicks on the push button, that ‘clicking’ event should be linked with \\nthe ‘callback handler’ function.Then only the button widget will appear as if it is \\nperforming some task. \\n As an example, let’s bind the button click with the function as: \\nb.bind('<Button-1>', buttonClick)\"),\n",

The preceding 3 steps make the widgets ready for the user. Now, the user has to \\ninteract with the widgets. This is done by entering text from the keyboard or pressing \\nmouse button. These are called events. These events are continuously monitored by \\nour program with the help of a loop, called ‘event loop’.  \\n As an example, we can use the mainloop() method that waits and processes the \\nevents as:  \\nroot.mainloop() \\nHere, ‘root’ is the object of root window in Python GUI. The events in root window are \\ncontinuously observed by the mainloop() method. It means clicking the mouse or \\npressing a button on the keyboard are accepted by mainloop() and then the mainloop() \\ncalls the corresponding even handler function.  \\nThe preceding steps will become clearer once we get into the actual programming. Hence, \\nlet’s proceed further to create a push button widget and handle the event generated by \\nthe user when the button is clicked.  \\nButton Widget \\nA push button is a component that performs some action when clicked. These buttons \\nare created as objects of Button class as: \\nb = Button(f, text=\\'My Button\\', width=15, height=2, bg=\\'yellow\\',  \\n  fg=\\'blue\\', activebackground=\\'green\\', activeforeground=\\'red\\') \\nHere, ‘b’ is the object of Button class. ‘f’  represents the frame for which the button is \\ncreated as a child. It means the button is shown in the frame. The ‘text’ option represents \\nthe text to be displayed on the button. ‘width’ represents the width of the button in \\ncharacters. If an image is displ ayed on the button instead of text, then ‘width’ represents \\nthe width in pixels. ‘height’ represents the height of the button in textual lines. If an \\nimage is displayed on the button, then ‘height’ represents the height of the button in \\npixels. ‘bg’ represents the foreground color and ‘fg’ represents the back ground color of \\nthe button. ‘activebackground’ represents the background color when the button is \\nclicked. Similarly, ‘activeforeground’ represents the foreground color when the button is \\nclicked.  \\nWe can also display an image on the button as: \\n# first load the image into file1 \\nfile1 = PhotoImage(file=\"cat.gif\") \\n \\n# create a push button with image \\nb = Button(f, image=file1, width=150, height=100, bg=\\'yellow\\',   \\n  fg=\\'blue\\', activebackground=\\'green\\', activeforeground=\\'red\\')'),\n",

The option ‘selectmode’ may take any of the following values: \\n\\uf071 BROWSE: Normally, we can select one item (or line) out of a list box.

For example, \\nwhen we click on ‘File’ menu, it may display options like ‘New’, ‘Open’, ‘Save’, etc. We can \\nselect any option depending on our requirements. ‘New’, ‘Open’, ‘Save’ –  these options are \\ncalled menu items. Thus, a menu is composed of several menu items. Similarly, ‘Edit’ is a \\nmenu with menu items like ‘Cut’, ‘Copy’, ‘Paste’, etc. Generally, we see menus displayed \\nin a bar, called menu bar. Consider Figure 22. 28 to understand the terms menu bar, \\nmenu and menu item: \\nFigure 22.28: A menu bar with menus and menu items displayed in the root window \\nTo create a menu, we should use the following steps: \\n1. First of all, we should create a menu bar as a child to root window. This is done using \\nMenu class as: \\nmenubar = Menu(root) \\n2. This menu bar should be attached to the root window using config() method as: \\nroot.config(menu=menubar) \\n3. The next step is to create a menu with a group of menu items. For this purpose, first \\nof all we should create Menu class object as: \\nfilemenu = Menu(root, tearoff=0) \\nHere, ‘filemenu’ is the Menu class object. The option ‘tearoff’ can be 0 o r 1. When this \\noption is 1, the menu can be torn off. In this case, the first position (position 0) in the \\nmenu items is occupied by the tear-off element which is a dashed line. If this option value \\nis 0, then this dashed line will not appear and the menu items are displayed starting \\nfrom 0th position onwards.  \\nThe next step is to add menu items to the filemenu object using the add_command() \\nmethod as: \\nfilemenu.add_command(label=\"New\", command=donothing) \\nHere, the menu item name is ‘New’ and when it is clic ked by the user, the method \\ndonothing() will be called. In this way, we can add any number of menu items to filemenu'),\n",

Observe the horizontal line below the ‘Save’ option and above the \\n‘Exit’ option. This horizontal line is called ‘separator’.  The second menu attached to the \\nmenu bar is the ‘Edit’ menu which has 3 menu items: Cut, Copy and Paste. But none of \\nthese menu items will work, except the ‘Exit’ menu item. When the user clicks on File \\uf0e0 \\nExit item, the destroy() method is called that destroys the root window and hence the root \\nwindow will be closed. When the other items like File \\uf0e0 Open is clicked, the donothing() \\nmethod is called that does nothing.  \\nCan’t we make the other menu items workable? Our intention is that when the user \\nclicks on File \\uf0e0 Open item, we want to display a file open dialog box where the user can \\nselect a file. Then we read data from the file and display it in a Text widget. This can be \\ndone by writing a method open_file(). In this method, first we should open a file dialog \\nbox for the user to select a file to open as: \\nfilename = filedialog.askopenfilename(parent=root, title=\\'Select a \\nfile\\', filetypes=((\"Python files\", \"*.py\"),(\"All files\",  \\n\"*.*\"))) \\nThe ‘filedialog’ is a sub module in tkinter and hence it should be imported separately. In \\nthis module, we have askopenfilename() method where we are supposed to specify which \\ntype of files to open using ‘filetypes’ option in the following format:  \\nfiletypes=((\"name\", \"extension\"), (\"name\", \"extension\")) \\nOnce the user selects a file in the dialog box, the filename i s available to us in ‘filename’ \\nobject. Now, we can open this file and read its contents and display them in a Text box.  \\nSimilarly, we can make the File \\uf0e0 Save item workable by writing a method save_file(). In \\nthis method, we should first open a file dialog box for the user and ask him the filename \\non which to save the data. This is done using asksaveasfilename() method of filedialog \\nmodule as: \\nfilename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(parent=root, \\ndefaultextension=\".txt\")'),\n",

Unfortunately, Python \\ndoes not provide a Table widget to create a table. But we can create a table using \\nalternate methods. For example, we can make a table by repeatedly displaying Entry \\nwidgets in the form of rows and columns.  \\nTo create a table with 5 rows and 4 columns, we can use 2 for loops as: \\nfor i in range(5):     \\n     for j in range(4): \\nInside these loops, we have to create an Entry widget by creating an object of Entry class, \\nas: \\ne = Entry(root, width=20, fg='blue', font=('Arial', 16, 'bold')) \\nNow, we need logic to place this Entry widget in rows and columns. This can be done \\nusing grid() method to which we can pass row and column positions, as: \\ne.grid(row=i, column=j)  # here i and j indicate row and column \\npositions \\nWe can insert data into the Entry widget using insert() method, as: \\ne.insert(END, data) \\nHere, ‘END’ indicates that the data continues to append at the end of the previous data in \\nthe Entry widget.  \\nThis logic is used in Program 23, to create a table using the data that is coming from a \\nlist. We have taken a list containing 5 tuples and each tuple contains 4 values which \\nindicate employee id number, name, city and salary. Hence we will have a table with 5 \\nrows and 4 columns in each row.

For example, if a computer wants to send a file on a network, it is not possible to \\nsend the entire file in a single step.

This layer receives data from the application and formats the data. \\nThen it sends that data to the next layer called TCP in the form of continuous stream of \\nbytes. The TCP, upon receiving the data from the Application layer, will divide it into \\nsmall segments called ‘packets’. A packet contains a group of bytes of data. These \\npackets are then sent to the next IP layer. IP layer inserts the packets into envelopes \\ncalled ‘frames’. Each frame contains a packet, the IP address of destination computer, the \\nIP address of source computer, and some additional bits useful in error detection and'),\n",

These frames are then sent to Data link layer which dispatches them to \\ncorrect destination computer on the network. The last layer, which is called the Physical \\nlayer, is used to physically transmit data on the network using the appropriate hardware.  \\nConsider Figure 23.1: \\nFigure 23.1: Packet, Frame and TCP/IP Protocol Layers \\nOf course, to send data from one place to another, first of all the computers should be \\ncorrectly identified on the network. This is done with the help of IP addresses. An IP \\naddress is a unique identification number given to every computer on the network. It \\ncontains four integer numbers in the range of 0 to 255 and separated by a dot as: \\n216.58.194.197 \\nThis IP address may represent, for example a website on a server machine on Internet as: \\nwww.gmail.com \\nTherefore, to open ‘gmail.com’ site, we can type the site address as ‘ www.gmail.com’ or its \\nIP address as ‘216.58.194.197 ‘. But when we type the IP address in numeric form, that \\nnumber is mapped to the website automatically. This mapping service is available on \\nInternet, which is called ‘DNS’ (Domain Naming service or system). So, Domain Naming \\nSystem (DNS) is a service on Internet that maps the IP addresses with corresponding \\nwebsite names. On Internet, IP addresses of 4 bytes are used and this version is called IP \\naddress version 4. The next new version of IP address is version 6, which uses 16 bytes \\nto identify a computer. \\nTCP/IP takes care of number of bits sent and whether all the bits are received duly by the \\ndestination computer. So it is ca lled ‘connection oriented reliable protocol’. Every \\ntransmitted bit is accountable in this protocol. Hence, this protocol is highly suitable for \\ntransporting data reliably on a network. Almost all the protocols on Internet use TCP/IP \\nmodel internally.'),\n",

POP \\n(Post Office Protocol) is useful to receive mails into the mail boxes. NNTP (Network News \\nTransfer Protocol) is used to transfer news articles on Internet.  \\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) \\nUDP is another protocol that transfers data in a connection less and unreliable manner. \\nIt will not check how many bits are sent or how many bits are actually received at the \\nother side. During transmission of data, there may be loss of some bits. Also, the data \\nsent may not be received in the same order. Hence UDP is generally not used to send \\ntext.

Similarly a client is a program that receives services from the servers. When a \\nserver wants to communicate with a client, there is a need of a socket. A socket is a point \\nof connection between the server and client. The following are the general steps to be \\nused at server side: \\n1. Create a TCP/IP socket at server side using socket() function. \\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) \\n Here, socket.AF_INET represents IP Address version 4 and socket.SOCK_STREAM \\nindicates that we are using TCP/IP protocol for communication with client. Anyhow, \\na socket uses IP address version 4 and TCP/IP protocol by default. Hence, we can \\ncreate a socket without giving protocol version and type of the protocol as: \\ns = socket.socket()   # this uses TCP/IP protocol by default \\n2. Bind the socket with host name and port number using bind() method. Here, host \\nname can be an IP Address or a web site name. If we want to run this program in an \\nindividual computer that is not connected in any network, then we can take hose \\nname as ‘localhost’. This represents that the server is running in the local system and \\nnot on any network. The IP Address of the ‘localhost’ is 127.0.0.1. As an alternative to \\n‘localhost’, we can also mention this IP Address. bind() method is us ed in the \\nfollowing format: \\ns.bind((host, port))   # here, (host, port) is a tuple. \\n3. We can specify maximum number of connections using listen() method as: \\ns.listen(5);   # maximum connections allowed are 5 \\n4. The server should wait till a client accepts connection. This is done using accept() \\nmethod as: \\nc, addr = s.accept()   # this method returns c and addr \\n Here, ‘c’ is connection object that can be used to send messages to the client. ‘addr’ is \\nthe address of the client that has accepted the connection.  \\n5. Finally, using send() method, we can send message strings to client. The message \\nstrings should be sent in the form of byte streams as they are used by the TCP/IP \\nprotocol.  \\nc.send(b\"message string\") \\n Observe the ‘b’ prefixed before the message stri ng. This indicates that the string is a \\nbinary string. The other way to convert a string into binary format is using encode() \\nmethod, as: \\nstring.encode() \\n6. After sending the messages to the client, the server can be disconnected by closing \\nthe connection object as: \\nc.close()'),\n",

A file stores data in the secondary storage \\ndevice, like hard disk, either in text format or binary format.  \\nA database represents collection of data. Just like a file, we can store data into a \\ndatabase.

We can store data, retrieve it, modify or delete it \\nby giving simple commands. These commands are written in a language called SQL \\n(Structured Query Language). Thus, a programmer’s duty is simplified. \\n\\uf071 Generally, each file contains data that is not related to another file’s data. When there \\nis no relationship between the files, it would be difficult to fulfill the information \\nneeds of the user. The user may wish to see the information that has some \\nrelationship and that is stored in various files. Accessing such data is difficult for the \\nprogrammers. In DBMS, various pieces of data can be related and retrieved easily \\nusing keys concept. \\n\\uf071 Files are not so efficient in handling large volumes of data. It would be a difficult task \\nto enter large data into a file or retrieving it from the file. But, DBMS can handle large \\nvolumes of data efficiently and easily. \\n\\uf071 When multiple users are accessing the data concurrently from the same file, there are \\nchances of wrong results or inconsistent changes to the existing data. DBMS will take \\ncare of such problems. \\n\\uf071 Once the changes are made to the file, we cannot roll them back. In case of DBMS, \\nwe can restore the previous state of data by rolling back the changes.  \\n\\uf071 Files offer very weak security for data; whereas, DBMS offers very good protection for \\nthe data.  \\nTypes of Databases Used with Python \\nWhen data is stored in a database like MySQL or Oracle, we can retrieve the data using a \\nPython program and process it in order to display the desired reports. It means our \\nPython programs can connect to various databases. Some of the important databases \\nwhich can be connected through Python are MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, \\nSybase, Informix, Firebird (and Interbase), IBM DB2, Ingres, PostgreSQL, SAP DB (also \\nknown as MaxDB) and Microsoft Access.  \\nTo work with any database, please remember that we should have that database already \\ninstalled in our computer system. To connect to that database, we need a driver or \\nconnector program that connects the database with Python programs. Then only we can \\ndevelop Python programs to connect to the database.  \\nIn this chapter, we will focus on two most important databases: MySQL and Oracle, and \\nhow to work with these databases in Python.

To perform some calculations on the tables of a database, \\nwe can use stored procedures. Stored procedures are written and stored at database \\nserver. When a client contacts the server, the stored procedure is executed, and the \\nresults are sent to the client. Let’s have more clarity on which one is client and which one \\nis server. In Oracle, the client is SQL command line application that displays SQL> \\nprompt. The server is the database server that runs in the system. This server takes the \\nSQL commands from the client, executes them and returns the results to the client. In \\nthis way, every database will have a client and database server.  \\nStored procedures are compiled once and stored in executable form at server side. The \\nmemory for stored procedures is not allocated every time they are called. Stored \\nprocedures are stored in cache memory at server side and they are immediately available \\nto clients. This makes speedy retrieval of data and information from the database. This is \\nthe main advantage of stored procedures. Stored procedures can be developed in all most \\nall databases like Oracle or MySQL.  \\nTo understand the stored procedure concept, let’s write a stored procedure in Oracle by \\nthe name ‘myproc.sql’ to increase the salary by Rs. 1000 of an employee whose eno is \\ngiven by the user.   Here we are assuming that the table emptab already exists in the \\ndatabase. First connect to the Oracle database and then type the following stored \\nprocedure at the SQL> prompt: \\n-- myproc.sql \\n-- to increase the salary of employee whose eno is given \\ncreate or replace procedure myproc(no in int, isal out float) as \\nsalary float; \\nbegin \\n    select sal into salary from emptab where eno=no; \\n    isal := salary+1000; \\nend; \\n/ \\nIn the last line, ‘/’ indicates to execute the procedure at server side. In the above code, we \\nuse create or replace keyword to create the procedure. The procedure name is ‘myproc’. It \\nhas two parameters: ‘no’ which is called in parameter and ‘isal’ which is called out \\nparameter. When a client calls this procedure, it supplies the value for in parameter. The \\nresult is calculated and stored in out parameter, which is sent back to the client. Figure \\n24.33 shows how to type the stored procedure:'),\n",

This salary is then \\nincremented by Rs.1000 and then stored into the out parameter ‘isal’. The value in ‘isal’ \\nis then available to the client.  \\nThe next step is calling this stored procedure from our Python program. To do so, we \\nneed the callproce() method of cursor object. For example, we can write: \\nresult = cursor.callproc('myproc' , args) \\nIn the above statement, callproc() is used to call the stored procedure: ‘myproc’.  After \\nprocedure’s name, we got ‘args’ that represents a list of arguments to be passed to the \\nprocedure. Since our stored procedure contains one ‘in’ parameter and one ‘out’ \\nparameter, we have to pass two arguments as:  \\nargs = [eno, isal] #pass eno as in parameter and isal as out parameter \\nTo retrieve the data from the out parameter, first we should declare the data type of the \\nparameter as: \\nisal = cursor.var(cx_Oracle.NUMBER) \\nHere, the out parameter is declared as NUMBER type. All types are defined in cx_Oracle \\nmodule as constants shown below:   \\ncx_Oracle.NUMBER \\ncx_Oracle.STRING \\ncx_Oracle.BOOLEAN \\ncx_Oracle.DATETIME \\nOnce the 2nd parameter (i.e., out parameter) is registered, the callproc() will execute the \\nprocedure and the result is returned into result variable.

To read the data from \\nExcel file, we should use read_excel() function of pandas package in the following format: \\nread_excel(‘file path’, ‘sheet number’) \\nIf our Excel file is availab le in ‘F:’ drive and ‘python \\\\PANDAS’ subdirectory, open the \\nPython IDLE window and type the commands as shown below:  \\n>>> import pandas as pd \\n>>> import xlrd \\n>>> df = pd.read_excel(\"f:\\\\\\\\python\\\\PANDAS\\\\empdata.xlsx\", \"Sheet1\") \\n \\n>>> df \\n \\n   empid           ename       sal        doj \\n0   1001      Ganesh Rao  10000.00 2000-10-10 \\n1   1002      Anil Kumar  23000.50 2002-03-20 \\n2   1003    Gaurav Gupta  18000.33 2002-03-03 \\n3   1004    Hema Chandra  16500.50 2000-09-10 \\n4   1005  Laxmi Prasanna  12000.75 2000-10-08 \\n5   1006       Anant Nag   9999.99 1999-09-09 \\nThus, we created the data frame by the name ‘df’. Please observe the first column having \\nnumbers from 0 to 5. This additional column is called ‘index column’ and added by the \\ndata frame. \\nCreating Data Frame from .csv Files \\nIn many cases, the data will be in the form of .csv files. A .csv file is a comma-separated \\nvalues file that is similar to an Excel file but it takes less memory.  We can create the .csv \\nfile by saving the Excel file using the option: File -> Save As and typing the following: \\nFile name: empdata \\nSave as type: CSV (Comma delimited) \\nWe can read data from a .csv file using read_csv() function that takes the file path as \\nshown below: \\n>>> import pandas as pd \\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(\"f:\\\\\\\\python\\\\PANDAS\\\\empdata.csv\") \\n \\n>>> df \\n \\n   empid           ename       sal        doj \\n0   1001      Ganesh Rao  10000.00   10-10-00 \\n1   1002      Anil Kumar  23000.50  3-20-2002 \\n2   1003    Gaurav Gupta  18000.33   03-03-02 \\n3   1004    Hema Chandra  16500.50   10-09-00 \\n4   1005  Laxmi Prasanna  12000.75   08-10-00 \\n5   1006       Anant Nag   9999.99   09-09-99 \\nCreating Data Frame from a Python Dictionary \\nIt is possible to create a Python dictionary that contains employee data. Let us remember \\nthat a dictionary stores data in the form of key- value pairs. In this case, we take ‘empid’,'),\n",

It returns a tuple that contains number of rows and columns as: \\n>>> df.shape \\n(6, 4) \\nSuppose, we want to retrieve only rows or columns, we can read that number from the \\ntuple as: \\n>>> r, c = df.shape \\n>>> print(r)   # display only no of rows \\n6 \\nRetrieving Rows from Data Frame \\nThe method head() gives the first 5 rows and the method tail() returns the last 5 rows, as \\nshown below: \\n>>> df.head() \\n \\n   empid           ename       sal         doj \\n0   1001      Ganesh Rao  10000.00  10-10-2000 \\n1   1002      Anil Kumar  23000.50    3-3-2002 \\n2   1003    Gaurav Gupta  18000.33    3-3-2002 \\n3   1004    Hema Chandra  16500.50    3-3-2002 \\n4   1005  Laxmi Prasanna  12000.75   10-8-2000 \\n \\n>>> df.tail() \\n \\n   empid           ename       sal        doj \\n1   1002      Anil Kumar  23000.50   3-3-2002 \\n2   1003    Gaurav Gupta  18000.33   3-3-2002 \\n3   1004    Hema Chandra  16500.50   3-3-2002'),\n",

For example, to \\nmake ‘empid’ column as index column for our data frame, we can write: \\n>>> df1 = df.set_index('empid')    \\nThe above statement creates another data frame ‘df1’ that uses ‘empid’ as index column. \\nWe can verify this by displaying df1 as: \\n>>> df1 \\n \\n                ename       sal         doj \\nempid                                       \\n1001       Ganesh Rao  10000.00  10-10-2000 \\n1002       Anil Kumar  23000.50    3-3-2002 \\n1003     Gaurav Gupta  18000.33    3-3-2002 \\n1004     Hema Chandra  16500.50    3-3-2002 \\n1005   Laxmi Prasanna  12000.75   10-8-2000 \\n1006        Anant Nag   9999.99    9-9-1999 \\nWe can find the empid being used as index column in the new data frame ‘df1’ as above. \\nHowever, the original data frame ‘df’ in this cas e is not modified and it still uses \\nautomatically generated index column.

For complete information about this \\nmodule, you can refer to the page:  \\nhttps://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html \\nBar Graph \\nA bar graph represents data in the form of vertical or horizontal bars. It is useful to \\ncompare the quantities. Now, let us see how to create a bar graph with employee id \\nnumbers on X-axis and their salaries on Y-axis. We will take this data from the data \\nframe.  First of all, we should import the packages as: \\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt   # for drawing the graph \\nimport pandas as pd   # for creating the data frame  \\nSuppose the data frame is created from ‘empdata’ as: \\ndf = pd.DataFrame(empdata) \\nThis data frame ‘df’ contains various pieces of data like empid, ename, sal and doj. We \\nwant to take only the ‘empid’ and ‘sal’ for the purpose of drawing the graph. This is done \\nas: \\nx = df['empid'] \\ny = df['sal'] \\nWe can draw the bar graph by calling bar() function of pyplot module as: \\nplt.bar(x, y, label='Employee data', color='red')  \\nWe can display a label (or title) on X-axis and Y-axis using xlabel() and ylabel) functions \\nas: \\nplt.xlabel('Employee ids') \\nplt.ylabel('Employee salaries') \\nWe can provide company’s title using title() function as: \\nplt.title('MICROSOFT INC') \\nWe can also display legend that refers to colors and labels of data especially when \\ndifferent sets of data are plotted as: \\nplt.legend()\"),\n",

This indicates the ranges from 0 to 9, 10 to 19, etc., \\nexcluding the outer limit. To draw the histogram, we should use hist() function as: \\nplt.hist(emp_ages, bins, histtype='bar', rwidth=0.8, color='cyan') \\nHere, histtype is ‘bar’ to show the histogram in the form of b ars. The other types can be \\n‘barstacked’, ‘step’, ‘stepfilled’. The option rwidth = 0.8 indicates that the bar’s width is \\n80%. There will be a gap of 10% space before and after the bar.

If \\nthis option is not mentioned, then it starts by default at 0 degrees (3 o’clock position).  \\nThe option explode=(0,0.2, 0,0) indicates whether the slices in the pie chart should stand \\nout or not. Here, 0 indicates that the corresponding slide will not come out of the chart. \\nBut the next 0.2 indicates that the second slice should come out slightly. Its values 0.1 to \\n1 indicate how much it should come out of the chart.  \\nThe option shadow=True indicates that the pie chart should be displayed with a shadow. \\nThis will improve the look of the chart. The option autopct=’%.1f%%’ indicates how to \\ndisplay the percentages on the slices. Here, %.1 indicates that the percentage value \\nshould be displayed with 1 digit after decimal point.

The original array and the newly \\ncreated arrays will share different memory locations. If the newly created array is \\nmodified, the original array will also be modified since the elements in both the arrays \\nwill be like mirror images.

The \\nmembers of the super class are reusable in the sub classes. Let’s remember that all \\nclasses in Python are built from a single super class called ‘object’. If a programmer \\ncreates his own classes, by default object class will become super class for them \\ninternally.

Thus \\ndecorators are useful to perform some additional processing required by a function. \\nDecorators concept is a bit confusing but not difficult to understand. The following steps \\nare generally involved in creation of decorators:  \\n1. We should define a decorator function with another function name as parameter. As \\nan example, let’s define a decorator function decor() with ‘fun’ as parameter.  \\ndef decor(fun): \\n2. We should define a function inside the decorator function. This function actually \\nmodifies or decorates the value of the function passed to the decorator function. As \\nan example, let’s write inner() function in the decor() function. Our assumption is that \\nthis inner() function increases the value returned by the function by 2.  \\ndef decor(fun):    \\n    def inner(): \\n        value = fun()   # access value returned by fun() \\n        return value+2   # increase the value by 2'),\n",
